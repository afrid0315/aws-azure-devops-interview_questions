**Answer.** Majorly there are five basic components of Linux:

**Kernel:** Linux kernel is a core part of the operating system that works as a bridge between hardware and software.

**Shell:** Shell is an interface between a kernel and a user.

**GUI:** Offers different way to interact with the system, known as the graphical user interface (GUI).

**Application programs:** It is designed to perform a bundle of tasks through a bundle of functions.

**System Utilities:** It is the software functions through which users manage the system.

#### 6. Elaborate all the file permission in Linux.
**Answer.** There are three types of file permissions in Linux:

- Read: Users open and read files with this permission.
- Write: Users can open and modify the files.
- Execute: Users can run the file.

#### 7. What is the Linux Kernel? Is it legal to edit it?
**Answer.** It is known as a low-level software system. The Linux kernel tracks the resources and provides a user interface. This OS is released under GPL (General Public License). Hence every project is released under it. So, you can edit the Linux kernel legally.

#### 8. Explain LILO
**Answer.** LILO, i.e., Linux Loader and is a Linux Boot loader. It loads the Linux operating system into memory and starts the execution. Most operating systems like Windows and macOS come with a bootloader. While in Linux, you need to install a separate boot loader, and LILO is one of the Linux boot loaders.

#### 9. What is Shell in Linux?
**Answer.** In Linux, five Shells are used:

- csh (C Shell): This shell offers job control and spell checking and is similar to C syntax.
- ksh (Korn Shell): A high-level shell for programming languages.
- ssh (Z Shell): This shell has a unique nature, such as closing comments, startup files, file name generating, and observing logout/login watching.
- bash (Bourne Again Shell): This is the default shell for Linux.
- Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell): This shell provides auto-suggestion, web-based configuration, etc.

#### 10. What is a root account?
**Answer.** The root is like the user’s name or system administrator account in Linux. The root account provides complete system control, which an ordinary user cannot do.

#### 11. Describe CLI and GUI in Linux.
**Answer.** CLI, i.e., command line interface. It takes input as a command and runs the tasks of the system. The term GUI refers to the Graphical User Interface or the human-computer interface. It uses icons, images, menus, and windows, which can be manipulated through the mouse.

#### 12. What is Swap Space?
**Answer.** A swap file or swap space is a portion of a computer's hard drive used as virtual memory when physical RAM is full. It prevents out-of-memory errors by temporarily storing inactive data. It's slower than RAM, so excessive swapping can impact performance. Proper configuration and sizing are important to maintain system stability without sacrificing performance.

#### 13. What is the difference between hard links and soft links?
**Answer.** Here is the table that shows the difference between soft links and hard links:
| Hard Links  | Soft Links  |
| --- | --- |
| It includes original content Links.  | It includes the original file location.  |
| Hard links are faster as compared to soft links.| Soft links are slower.|
| It shares similar inode numbers.  | It shares different inode numbers.  |
| There is no relative path for hard links. | Relative paths are used for soft links. |
| It didn’t link the directories.  | It links the directories. |
| Any change in this link reflects other files directly. | Every change in this link reflects its hard link and the actual file directly.|
| It uses less memory. | It uses more memory. |

#### 14. How do users create a symbolic link in Linux? What scenario you faced and how did you fix that?
**Answer.** Symbolic links, symlink, or soft links are shortcuts to files and directories. Users can create the symbolic link in Linux through the’ ln’ command. The general command to create a symbolic link is as follows:
```
ln -s <existing_source file> <optional_symbolic link>
```

Scenario: Suppose you have a symbolic link pointing to a file, and the target file gets deleted or moved. The symlink becomes a "dangling symlink," pointing to a non-existent location.

#### 15. What do you understand about the standard streams?
**Answer.** Output and input in Linux OS are divided into three standard streams: 

- Stdin (standard input)
- stdout(standard output)
- stderr (standard error)
Under Linux, these standard streams channel communication of output and input between programs and their environment.

#### 16. How do you mount and unmount filesystems in Linux?
**Answer.** In this case, you can use the ‘mount’ and ‘umount’ commands.

**For mounting:**
First, identify the partition through the fdisk -l command. You can also use the lsblk command for it.
After identifying the partition, create the directory which will work as the mount point. For example, running the mkdir /mnt/mountpnt will create the mountpnt directory as the mount point.
Finally, you can run sudo mount <partition> <mount_point_directory> to complete the mounting.

**For Unmounting:**
Once you check if the specific filesystem is in use, you can run the `sudo umount <mount_point_directory>` for unmounting.

#### 17. How do you troubleshoot network connectivity issues in Linux?
**Answer.** There are multiple ways to troubleshoot the network connectivity and find the issue correctly:

**Check the Internet Connectivity:** First of all, please check if the internet connection option is on and also check the cables to find if there is any issue with it.

**Verify the Network Configuration:**
Please check that your network is configured correctly and the network interface has your IP address. You can check it by running the ip addr or ifconfig commands.
You can also run the ip route command to check if the default gateway is set properly.
Finally, verify the DNS server configuration in the /etc/resolv.conf file.

**Check the Firewall:**
Sometimes, firewall rules block the internet connection for the system’s security. Hence, you can run the ufw or iptables command to modify the firewall rules.

**Network Interface:**
You can restart your network interface through the ifup and ifdown commands. Once you restart the network interface, please reboot the system to make changes successful.

#### 18. How do you list all the processes running in Linux?
**Answer.** You can list the currently running process in Linux through various commands such as:

**ps Command:**
The ps command displays brief information about the running processes. You can use the ps -f or ps -ef command because the -f option shows the full-format result, and the -e option displays all processes. Moreover, you can use the ps auxf command to get a detailed list of processes.

**top and htop Command:**
The top command displays the real-time details about the system process and the complete resource usage.
The htop command is the improved version of the top command because it displays the color-coded list with additional features such as sorting, filtering, etc.

#### 19. What is the chmod command in Linux, and how do you use it?
**Answer.** You can use the chmod command to change the file permissions of the directories. It offers a simple way to control the read and write permissions. For instance, if you want to change the permission of the ABC.sh script and give it the write and executable permission, you can run the below command:

`chmod u+wx ABC.sh`

The chmod command is not limited to the write (w), read (r), and executable (x) permissions because there are symbolic modes and numeric modes, which you can learn from this guide.

#### 20. How do you check disk space usage?
**Answer.** There are some simple commands you can use to check disk space usage, such as:

**df Command:**
The df or disk-free command shows the used and the available disk space. You can use the additional options to check disk space differently. For instance, you can use the df -h command to check the disk usage in the human-readable format.

**du Command:**
The du or disk usage command estimates and shows the disk space usage, so running the du command with no option shows the disk usage of your current directory. However, you can run the following command to check the disk usage of a specific directory:

`du -sh ~/<directory> `

**ncdu Command:**
The NCurses Disk Usage, or ncdu command, displays more interactive disk usage. Similar to the du command, the ncdu command also requires the path of the specific directory to check its space.

#### 21. How do you find the process ID (PID) of a running process?
**Answer.** You can use the following command to find the Process ID or PID of the currently running process:

**pgrep Command:**
The pgrep command shows the PID of a process through its name or other different attributes. For example, you can find the PID of process_1 using the below command:

`pgrep <process_1>`

**ps Command:**
ps command not only displays the currently running process but also shows the process’s PID. However, if you want to check the PID of a specific process, you can combine the ps with the grep command:

`ps -e | grep -i <process_1>`

#### 22. What is the rsync command, and how do you use this command for synchronization?
**Answer.** The rsync command is used to synchronize and transfer the files in Linux. It synchronizes files between two local systems, directories, or a network. The basic rsync command contains the following:

`rsync <options> <source> <destination>`

For example, let’s synchronize between Documents and the Downloads directory. For this, you need to run the following command:

`rsync -av ~/Documents ~/Downloads`


If you want to go one step further, then you can use the below command:

`rsync -avz --delete ~/Documents ~/Downloads`

In the above command:
- The -a option preserves all the permissions and other attributes.
- The -v option displays the detailed output of the synchronization
- The -z allows compression that decreases the bandwidth use.
- The –delete option removes the file in the Downloads that do not exist in the Documents directory.

#### 23. How do you create a user account?
**Answer.** You can use adduser and useradd commands to create a user for the system.

`useradd Command:`

Let’s create a username, “Ron,” and provide a password for accessing the system:
```
useradd Ron 
passwd Ron 
```

You can also explore the useradd command’s additional options to modify the new user’s permissions and privileges.

`adduser Command:`

The adduser command is similar to the useradd command, so let’s create a username “Shawn”:
```
adduser Shawn
passwd Shawn
```

#### 24. How do you format a disk in Linux?
**Answer.** The mkfs or make file system command helps format the disk in the Linux system. All you need to do is use the following method to format the disk:

First, run the lsblk command to list the available partitions and identify which disk you want to format.

If the selected disk is mounted, then unmount it through the following command:

`umount <partition>`

Now, find the file system type of the disk, like EXT4, NTFS, or XFS. Once you are done then, run one of the following commands according to the file system type:
```
mkfs.ext4 <partition>
mkfs.xfs <partition>
mkfs.ntfs <partition>
```
Finally, mount the disk again through the mount command after the successful format. Moreover, please ensure that you have created a complete disk backup to eliminate the chances of data loss.

#### 25. How do you change the password for a user account?
**Answer.** Changing the password of a user account is simple because all you need to do is use the passwd command:

`passwd username`

For example, let’s change the password of a user “Ron” through the below command:

`passwd Ron `

Once you run the command, the system will ask you to enter and confirm the new password.

#### 26. What is the difference between a process and a thread?
**Answer.** In Linux, processes are the independent program, while a thread is the unit of execution. So here are the complete differences between process and thread:
| Comparison Factors  | Process  | Thread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creation time  | Creation time is higher  | Creation time is less. |
| Dependency | It is independent because it does not share memory. | It depends on other threads because they share some memory with other threads. |
| Resource  | Resource use is higher  | Requires lesser resources |
| Termination time | The termination time is higher | The termination time is less. |

Process:

A process is an instance of a running program on a computer system.
It is an independent entity that has its own memory space, system resources, and execution environment.
Each process is isolated from other processes, meaning that changes made by one process do not directly affect the memory or execution of another process.
Processes communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as pipes, sockets, or shared memory.
Examples of processes include web browsers, word processors, media players, and system services.
Thread:

A thread is a lightweight execution unit within a process.
Threads share the same memory space and system resources as their parent process.
Multiple threads within the same process can concurrently execute code and share data.
Threads within a process can communicate directly by accessing shared memory, which allows for more efficient communication compared to inter-process communication.
Threads are commonly used to perform parallel or concurrent tasks within a single process, such as handling user input, performing background tasks, or processing data in parallel.
Threads are cheaper to create and manage compared to processes, as they share resources and do not require the overhead of creating a separate memory space.
In summary:

A process is an independent instance of a running program with its own memory and resources.
A thread is a lightweight execution unit within a process that shares the same memory and resources as other threads in the same process.
Processes provide isolation and security by running independently of each other, while threads allow for concurrent execution within a single process, facilitating parallelism and multitasking.

#### 27. What is the ulimit command, and how do you use it?
**Answer.** The ulimit command controls the resource limit for the user process. You can use the ulimit command to set the limit on the system resource to prevent consuming the higher resources. This command contains multiple options to set the limit. For example, you can use the u option to set a maximum number of processes to 50:

`ulimit -u 50 `

#### 28. What is the find command, and how do you use it?
**Answer.** The find command searches for files based on different factors such as name, size, permissions, etc. Here is the basic command:

`find <directory> <file>`

For example, let’s find a Linux.txt file located in the Downloads directory through the below command:

`find ~/Downloads -name Linux.txt`

Once you run the above command, the find command will start finding the Linux.txt in the Downloads directory and subdirectories.

#### **29. What is RAID in Linux?
**Answer.** The full form of RAID is the Redundant Array of Independent Disk that allows the system to combine the different physical disk drives into a logical unit. RAID is used to improve the system’s disk performance and data integrity. There are different RAID levels you can configure according to the requirements. Here is the detailed information about the RAID levels:
| RAID Level  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| RAID 0  | It is called striping, which allows you to split the data into multiple disks without redundancy.  |
| RAID 1 | It is called mirroring, which allows you to create a complete copy of data on multiple disks. |
| RAID 5  | It distributes the parity information and data on multiple disks.  |
| RAID 6 | It is the improved version of RAID 5 as it uses two sets of parity information to provide higher data redundancy. |
| RAID 10 | It combines RAID 0 and RAID 1 to generate the set of mirror disks to improve performance and redundancy. |

#### 30. What are the challenges of using Linux?
**Answer.** There are numerous challenges that a user faces while using Linux:

- Linux shows hardware compatibility issues in certain devices because manufacturers prioritize Windows compatibility.
- Learning Linux is not easy because the configuration and commands require proper knowledge.
- Although Linux supports Steam, it still needs to be impressed regarding game compatibility and availability.
- Sometimes users face driver and firmware-related issues.

#### 31. What is the /proc file system?
**Answer.** /proc (Proc File System) is the virtual file system that shows information about the system and the Kernel data structures. It is the essential interface to access the system, perform debugging tasks, check the Kernel functioning, find process-related information, and many more.

Therefore, you can use /proc file system in Linux to get information about the system and modify the particular Kernel parameters at the runtime.

#### 32. How do you secure a Linux server?
**Answer.** There are multiple methods to secure the Linux server and protect it from data breaches, security threats, and unauthorized access. Here are some of these methods:

- Create a strong password.
- Update the server and apply security patches.
- Use secured protocols like SSH and configure it to use key-based authentication for higher security.
- Use the intrusion detection system (IDS) to monitor network traffic and prevent malicious activities.
- Configure the firewall to limit the inbound and outbound traffic on the server.
- Disable all unused network services.
- Create regular backups.
- Review logs and perform regular security audits.
- Encrypt network traffic and enable monitoring.

#### 33. What is strace command?
**Answer.** The strace command is the diagnostic utility by which you can trace and monitor the system calls generated by the process. It allows you to find how programs interact with Kernel and can be used for debugging and troubleshooting. For example, let’s find the system calls generated by the ls command:

`strace ls`

Once you run the above command, the system will start tracing the list command and show the system calls generated by it. Output from the above command includes information like call name, argument, and return values.

#### 34. How do you optimize Linux system performance?
**Answer.** You can optimize the Linux performance through various strategies to improve resource usage and efficiency. So some of the strategies are:

- Updates the system as per the latest one available.
- Optimize the disk, enable the caching, and optimize the access pattern.
- Manage memory and CPU usage.
- Disable the necessary services and use lightweight alternatives of the tools.
- Monitor the system resources regularly.
- Perform the Kernel parameter tune-up.
- Use tools like Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) to monitor system-level performance.

#### 35. How to administer Linux servers?
**Answer.** Administering a Linux server requires different strategies and management to maintain the overall functionalities. Here are some major strategies you can follow:

- Handle user account management and assign appropriate access permissions.
- Configure the system to optimize the performance, improve the security and maintain the network connectivity.
- Implement the backup strategy to perform regular backups of the server.
- Implement the monitoring tools to track resource usage, system performance, and network.
- Configure firewall, set up intrusion detection, manage user permissions and configure the SSH.
- Create a proper recovery planning that must include regular backup, critical configuration documentation, recovery process testing, and offsite storage.

#### **36. What is a Linux virtual memory system? If its not present in hardware, how does it store data?
**Answer.** Virtual memory is a great memory management utility in any OS. You can use the virtual memory system as secondary memory. This memory is used by both software and hardware in Linux so that your system can cope with the lack of physical memory. Moreover, virtual memory is also used to compensate for the RAM usage by transferring the data temporarily from RAM to disk storage.

**Real-Life Example:**
Imagine you're working on a computer with limited RAM, and you have multiple applications open simultaneously. Virtual memory allows the operating system to use a portion of the hard disk as if it were additional RAM. When the physical RAM becomes fully occupied, less frequently used data is moved to the disk, making room for actively used data in RAM. This enables you to run more applications than the physical RAM would otherwise allow, preventing system slowdowns or crashes.

If virtual memory is not supported by hardware, the operating system would rely solely on software-based techniques to manage memory. In such a scenario, the operating system would still use disk storage as an extension of RAM when needed, but it would handle all memory management tasks without hardware assistance. This could involve techniques such as swapping, where parts of the program's memory are temporarily moved to disk when not actively in use, and then brought back into RAM when needed again. However, without hardware support like a Memory Management Unit (MMU), these operations might be less efficient and more reliant on CPU processing power.

#### 37. What do you understand about process scheduling in Linux?
**Answer.** Process scheduling is the mechanism that identifies the order of processes running on the system. In other words, process scheduling determines the order and execution time of multiple processes running on the system concurrently. This process scheduler of Linux is priority-based and uses a preemptive algorithm. It allocates CPU time for different processes to ensure efficient CPU resource usage. These processes are dynamic, and their order can change depending on many factors, such as resource usage, process behavior, and scheduling policies.

#### 38. What are the most important Linux commands?
**Answer.** There are a ton of useful commands in Linux, and here are some of the commonly used commands:

- ls: Display directory contents such as folders and files.
- mkdir: Used to create a new directory.
- pwd: Shows the current directory.
- top: Display system running processes and resource usage.
- grep: Search a specific pattern in a file.
- cat: Through this command, users can add multiple files and also display the content of the files.
- tar: Archives directories and files into a tarball.
- wget: Download files from the browser or web.
- free: Shows memory usage.
- df: Shows disk space usage.
- man: Gives a manual page for a specific command that displays instructions and details.

#### 39. If you are facing any issue with an internal server error, How you will troubleshoot?
**Answer.** To troubleshoot an internal server error:
- Check Logs: Examine server logs for errors.
- Review Code: Look into recent code changes.
- Verify Permissions: Ensure correct file permissions.
- Test Components: Isolate and test components.
- Review Configuration: Check server configuration files.
- Update Software: Ensure all software is up-to-date.

#### 40. How do you troubleshoot a Linux OS that fails to boot?
**Answer.** In case of the system boot failure, you can follow various approaches such as:

- Check the warning and error messages you get during the boot process because it can help you diagnose the issues.
- Check the boot logs to find the exact reason behind the boot error.
- Open the GRUB bootloader and check the boot options to solve the booting problems.
- Check the hardware connections like cables, RAM, cooling fan, etc.
- If the system shows an error message related to the Kernel, try to boot it with the older Kernel version from GRUB.
- Identify the last changes you made in the system before the boot.

#### 41. What is the init process in Linux?
**Answer.** The init or also called the initialization process is the first process that begins during the system boot. It is responsible for initializing and processing the system in its functional state. Hence, init works as the parent process because its process ID is 1. Originally Linux systems used to have SysV init, but now it is developed as the systemd init (an improved version of SysV).

#### 42. What is SMTP?
**Answer.** SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. This set of communication guidelines allows the software to transmit electronic mail online. The main aim of SMTP is to set communication rules between servers. There are two models of SMTP:
- End-to-end model: This model is used to connect different organizations.
- Store-and-forward model: This model is used within an organization.

#### 43. What is LVM in Linux?
**Answer.** The full form of LVM is Logical Volume Manager, which provides an advanced disk management approach in Linux. It is a subsystem that allows a user to efficiently allocate the disk space on the physical storage device.

You can use the LVM to create the logical volume for easy storage management through various features like resizing, volume mirroring, and snapshots. LVM is a powerful utility for disk management where you need dynamic storage allocations.

#### 44. What is the difference between UDP and TCP?
**Answer.** The following table shows the difference between UDP and TCP:
| Factors | UDP | TCP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection-oriented | UDP does not establish a proper connection. | TCP is connection-oriented because it establishes a connection between the sender and receiver. |
| Reliability | UDP does not provide a reliability mechanism. | It guarantees reliable data delivery by retransmitting corrupt packets or lost packets. |
| Usage | It is used in low overhead, speed, and real-time communication applications. | It is used where ordered data is delivered, and reliable data must be delivered. |
| Applications | Video/voice conferencing, DNS, online gaming, streaming media, etc. | File transfers, email, web browsing, database transactions, etc. |

#### 45. What is /etc/resolv.conf file
**Answer.** The /etc/resolv.conf is the config file used for the DNS server resolution process. This config file is used to specify the DNS server, set up the search directive for domains, and configure the resolver options.

#### 46. What is the difference between absolute and relative paths in Linux?
**Answer.** Absolute path = It specifies the exact location of a file or directory from the root directory (“/”). We will notice that they always start with a forward slash (“/”).

For Example: `/home/user/jayesh/geeksforgeeks.txt`

Relative paths = It specifies the location relative to the current working directory. In this we do not start with a forward slash (“/”).

For Example: `documents/file.txt`

#### 47. What is the grep command used for in Linux?
**Answer.** The grep command is used to search for specific patterns within files or input streams. It allows us to find and print lines that we give to match the pattern.

For example: If we want to search `test` in a text file name “file.txt”. We use the following command

`grep "test" file.txt`

This command will search for the word `test` in the file named “file.txt” and print the matching lines.

#### 48. How do you check the status of a service or daemon in Linux?
**Answer.** To check the status of a service or daemon, we can use the `systemctl` command followed by the service name.

For example: If we want to display the status of the Apache Web server. We use the following command.

`systemctl status apache2`

It will show whether the service is running, stopped, or in an error state.

#### 49. What is the difference between /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files?
**Answer.** The /etc/passwd file stores essential user information like usernames, user IDs, home directories, and default shells. Each line in the file represents a user account.

The /etc/shadow file contains encrypted passwords and other security-related information. It is only accessible by the root user or privileged processes

#### 50. How do you compress and decompress files in Linux?
**Answer.** To compress files in Linux, you can use the tar command along with gzip compression.

For example: If we want to create a file name “jayesh” with gzip compression. We use the following command.

`tar -czvf jayesh.tar.gz files`

This command will create a compressed archive file containg the specified “files”

To decompress the same, we use the following command.

`tar -xzvf jayesh.tar.gz`

#### 51. What is the difference between a process and a daemon in Linux?
**Answer.** A process is an executing instance of a program. It can be a foreground process that interacts with the user or a background process started by a user or another process.

A daemon is a background process that runs independently of user sessions. It is typically started at system boot time and performs system tasks or provides services. Daemons often have no user interaction and continue running even when users log out.

#### 52. How do you schedule recurring tasks in Linux?
**Answer.** We can use `crontab` command for performing recurring tasks in Linux. By adding entries to the crontab file, we can specify when and how frequently a command or script should be executed

For Example: If we want to execute a script name “geeks.sh” every day at 3:30 AM. We use the following command.

crontab -e\
This command opens the crontab file in an editor.

30 3 * * * /path/to/geeks.sh

#### 53. What is the sed command used for in Linux?
**Answer.** The sed command is used to perform text transformations on files. It can search for specific patterns and replace them with desired text.

For Example:

`sed `s/foo/bar/g` file.txt`

This command replaces all occurrences of “foo” with “bar” in the file name “file.txt”

#### 54. What are runlevels in Linux?
**Answer.** Runlevels in Linux define different system states, such as single-user mode or multi-user mode with or without a GUI. They determine which services start or stop during system startup and shutdown. The default runlevel is often set to a multi-user mode with a GUI (runlevel 5). Runlevel 3 is commonly used for a multi-user mode without a GUI.

#### 55. What is sudo in Linux?
**Answer.** The word “sudo” is the short form of “Superuser Do” that allows you to run the command with system privileges. With this command, you can get the system’s administrative access to perform various tasks. The sudo command requires a password before the execution to verify the user’s authorization.

#### 56. What is umask?
**Answer.** It is used for user file creation mode. When a user creates any file, then it has default file permission. Umask specifies restrictions for these permissions on the file, i.e., controls the permissions.

#### 57. How to find and kill a process in Linux?
**Answer.** You can use different commands to kill a process, but first, you must find the PID of that specific process. So, please run the below command:

`ps aux | grep <process>`

Once you get the PID of the process then run the kill command to end it:

`kill <PID>`

If you don’t want to find the PID, then you can use the pkill command to kill a process by its name:

`pkill <process>`

The pkill command sends a signal (by default, SIGTERM) to the matched processes, causing them to terminate.

#### 58. What is network bonding in Linux?
**Answer.** Network bonding is the process of creating a single network by combining two or more network interfaces. This combination of networks improves redundancy and performance by increasing bandwidth and throughput. The major benefit of network bonding is that the overall network works fine even if a single network in the bonding does not work properly.

#### 59. What is SELinux?
**Answer.** SELinux or also known as Security-Enhanced Linux, is the security framework. It offers an additional layer of security to improve access control and strengthen security. SELinux was developed to improve the security policies to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. However, learning about SELinux is essential before working on it can create serious security issues.

#### 60. What is the purpose of the SSH protocol in Linux, and how do you securely connect to a remote server using SSH?
**Answer.** The Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol in Linux which is used to establish a secure encrypted connection between a local and remote machine. It allows to securely access and manage remote servers. If we want to connect to a remote server using SSH. We can use the following command.

#### **71. What is booting and explain are steps in detail (Linux/Windows).
**Answer.** 
Booting is the process of initializing a computer's operating system and making it ready for use.

**Linux Boot Process:**

(BIOS/UEFI->POST->MBR->GRUB->KERNEL->INIT->SERVICES START)
- BIOS/UEFI: When computer powered on, BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input/Output System or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is initialized. BIOS/UEFI performs Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check hardware components like CPU, storages and others... Then Boot Loader loads in booting device from BIOS/UEFI settings. Boot Loader is GRUB (Grand Boot Loader) which is used in most linux distributions.
- MBR: MBR (Master Boot Record) is less than 512 bytes in size. This has three components 1) primary boot loader info in 1st 446 bytes 2) partition table info in next 64 bytes 3) mbr validation check in last 2 bytes. It contains information about GRUB (or LILO in old systems). So, in simple terms MBR loads and executes the GRUB boot loader.
- Boot Loader (GRUB): GRUB is reponsible for the initializing hardware components and loading linux kernel into memory from the boot partition.
- Linux Kernel Initialization: Once Linux kernel loads into memory then the Init process starts, initializes hardware, mounts the root file system.
- Init Process: The init process (or a modern equivalent like systemd) initializes user space components, services, and runs startup scripts. Allowing users to interact with the system.
  
(https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/02/linux-boot-process/)
**Windows Boot Process:**

- Power-On Self-Test (POST): Hardware is tested during POST, and the system's firmware (UEFI or BIOS) is activated.
- Boot Loader (Windows Boot Manager): The boot loader, often Windows Boot Manager, loads the Windows Boot Configuration Data (BCD) and presents a menu if multiple OS options exist.
- Windows Kernel Initialization: The Windows kernel (ntoskrnl.exe) is loaded into memory and initializes essential system components.
- Session Manager (Wininit.exe): The Session Manager starts, initializing system processes and drivers.
- Winlogon and User Initialization: Winlogon starts, and user-specific processes and services are initiated.
- User Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) is presented, and the user can log in.

In both cases, the boot process involves initializing hardware, loading the operating system's kernel, and transitioning from a pre-boot environment to a fully functional user environment.

#### 72. What is the iptables command, and how to use it for network filtering?
**Answer.** The iptables command configures Netfilter firewall rules providing the network address translation, packet filtering, etc. iptables inspects the network packet and then manages them according to the defined rules. Here is how you can use the iptables command for network filtering: 

Run the below command to display the current iptables rules, including policies, chains, and other actions for the network:

`iptables -L`

The iptables configuration uses the predefined set of chains to process the network packages at different stages. So you can define rules to these chains for manipulating the network packets:

`iptables -A <chain> <options> -j <target>`

In the above command:
```
<chain>: Specifies the chain where you want to define a new rule.
<options>: Defines the conditions for the rule, like ports, protocols, etc.
-j <target>: Defines the target action when the packet matches the rule.
```
By default, iptables rules get automatically removed after the system reboot, but you can use the following command to make the rules persistent:

`iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4`

#### 73. Managing system services and background processes.

In essence, it allows the system to perform multiple computations or tasks concurrently, improving efficiency and throughput compared to a single-processor system.
**Benefits:**
- Increased performance due to concurrent execution.
- Scalability by adding more processors.
- Higher throughput for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Redundancy and fault tolerance capabilities.
- Efficient resource sharing and load balancing.
- Enhanced multitasking and parallel processing abilities.

#### 124. Explain about fork()?
**Answer.** fork() is a system call in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that creates a new process by duplicating the existing process. This results in two separate processes: the parent process and the child process. The child process is an exact copy of the parent process, except for a few differences such as their process IDs and return values from fork().

#### 125. What is a Scheduling Algorithm? Name different types of scheduling algorithms.
**Answer.** A scheduling algorithm determines the order in which tasks or processes are executed on a computing system.

Different types of scheduling algorithms include:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
- Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF): The next process to be executed is the one with the smallest execution time.
- Priority Scheduling: Processes are assigned priorities, and the one with the highest priority is executed first.
- Round Robin (RR): Each process gets a small unit of CPU time, and if it doesn't finish within that time, it's moved to the back of the queue.
- Multilevel Queue Scheduling: Processes are divided into different queues with different priorities, and each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.
- Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling: Similar to multilevel queue scheduling, but processes can move between queues based on their behavior.

#### 126. what is the difference between multitasking and multiprocessing OS?
**Answer.** Multitasking OS allows multiple tasks to run concurrently on a single CPU, while multiprocessing OS utilizes multiple CPUs to execute tasks simultaneously, enhancing overall system performance.

#### 127. What is the difference between paging and segmentation?
**Answer.** Paging and segmentation are memory management techniques used by operating systems:

Paging: Divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks called "pages" and logical memory into same-sized blocks called "frames." Processes are divided into pages, which are loaded into available frames in physical memory. Paging allows for efficient memory allocation but may lead to external fragmentation.

Segmentation: Divides the logical address space of a process into variable-sized segments. Each segment represents a logical unit of the program, such as code, data, or stack. Segmentation allows for more flexible memory allocation and sharing but may lead to fragmentation within segments.

#### 128. What is cache? What are its different types? Explain the entire process of searching in memory using hit and miss.
**Answer.** Cache is a high-speed memory subsystem that stores frequently accessed data or instructions to reduce the average time it takes to access them from the main memory. It serves as a buffer between the CPU and the slower main memory, speeding up data access by keeping copies of frequently accessed data closer to the processor.

Different types of cache include:

CPU Cache: Located on the CPU chip itself, CPU cache includes Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), and Level 3 (L3) caches, with L1 being the smallest and fastest and L3 being the largest and slower.

Memory Cache: Also known as disk cache, memory cache stores frequently accessed data from the main memory in faster cache memory, such as RAM or SSDs.

The process of searching in memory using cache involves two scenarios: hit and miss.

Hit: When the processor requests data that is already present in the cache, it's called a cache hit. In this case, the data is retrieved directly from the cache, resulting in a fast access time.

Miss: If the requested data is not found in the cache, it's called a cache miss. The processor then needs to fetch the data from the slower main memory and load it into the cache for future access. This incurs a delay due to the longer access time of the main memory.

Overall, the goal of caching is to maximize the number of hits and minimize the number of misses, thereby improving the overall performance of the system.

#### 129. My device is heating up very quickly. Troubleshoot the scenario device. justify your answer.
**Answer.** To troubleshoot a device heating up quickly:

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can identify and address the underlying causes of the device overheating, thereby improving its performance and prolonging its lifespan.

#### 130. Explain framing.
**Answer.** Framing is a technique used in data link layer protocols to delineate and identify the boundaries of frames within a stream of data. It involves adding special bit sequences called "flags" or "start-stop" bits at the beginning and end of each frame. These flags help the receiver identify the start and end of each frame, allowing for reliable transmission and reception of data packets over a communication channel.

#### 131. What is a bootstrap program in OS?
**Answer.** A bootstrap program, often referred to as a bootloader, is a small program stored in non-volatile memory (such as ROM or EEPROM) that initializes the operating system (OS) during the system boot process. It is typically the first program to run when a computer is powered on, and its primary function is to load the operating system kernel into memory and transfer control to it, thereby starting the operating system.

#### 132. Explain demand paging?
**Answer.** Demand paging is a memory management technique used by operating systems to efficiently manage memory resources. Instead of loading an entire program into memory when it starts, demand paging loads only the necessary portions of a program into memory as they are needed. When a process references a memory page that is not currently in physical memory, a page fault occurs, triggering the operating system to fetch the required page from disk into memory. This approach helps conserve memory by loading only the most essential pages into memory, reducing the overall memory footprint of running processes and improving system performance.

#### 133. What do you mean by RTOS?
**Answer.** RTOS stands for Real-Time Operating System. It is an operating system designed to manage real-time tasks with strict timing constraints. RTOS ensures that tasks are completed within specific time limits, making it suitable for applications where timing predictability and responsiveness are critical, such as industrial automation, aerospace systems, and embedded devices.

#### 134. Explain zombie process?
**Answer.** A zombie process is a terminated process that has completed its execution but still has an entry in the process table. It retains some process information, such as its process ID and exit status, but it no longer has an active execution context. Zombie processes typically occur when a parent process fails to call the wait() system call to retrieve the exit status of its terminated child process. These zombie processes consume system resources until their parent process acknowledges their termination by calling wait(), at which point they are removed from the process table.

#### 135. What is thrashing in OS?
**Answer.** Thrashing in operating systems refers to a state of excessive paging activity, where the system is spending more time swapping data between main memory and disk than executing useful work. It occurs when the system is overwhelmed by the demand for memory, causing a constant state of page faults and disk I/O operations, leading to a significant decrease in overall system performance.

#### 136. I am trying media over FTP from one device to another. The rate of transfer is very slow. Troubleshoot the scenario.
**Answer.** To troubleshoot slow media transfer over FTP:

- Check Network Connection: Ensure both devices are connected to a stable and fast network, preferably using wired connections for optimal speed.
- Verify FTP Server Configuration: Confirm that the FTP server's configuration allows for sufficient bandwidth allocation and concurrent connections.
- Check Device Resources: Verify that both the sender and receiver devices have adequate processing power, memory, and disk space to handle the transfer efficiently.
- Consider Network Congestion: Check for network congestion or bandwidth limitations, especially if multiple devices are sharing the same network.
- Review FTP Client Settings: Adjust FTP client settings to use passive mode, which can sometimes improve transfer speeds, especially in firewall-restricted environments.
- Optimize File Compression: If feasible, compress the media files before transferring them to reduce their size and speed up the transfer process.
- Monitor Transfer Speed: Use network monitoring tools to measure the actual transfer speed and identify any bottlenecks or limitations in the network or devices.
- Update Software and Drivers: Ensure that both the FTP client and server software, as well as network drivers, are up to date to benefit from performance optimizations and bug fixes.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can identify and address the underlying issues causing slow media transfer over FTP, thereby improving the transfer speed and efficiency.

#### 137. Memory management, Memory pages, Basic commands?
**Answer.** Memory management involves organizing and controlling computer memory, ensuring efficient use of available resources.

Memory pages are fixed-size blocks used in virtual memory systems for memory allocation and management.

Basic commands for memory management include malloc (allocate memory), free (release memory), memset (set memory values), and memcpy (copy memory content).

#### 138. Troubleshooting: I am not able to connect to the internet.
**Answer.** To troubleshoot internet connectivity issues:

- Check Network Connection: Ensure cables are properly connected, and Wi-Fi is enabled if applicable.

#### 139. Scenario: You have 4 GB RAM Mobile, What do you think can we able to play 8GB Game.
**Answer.** No, it's unlikely. Mobile games typically require RAM similar to or slightly higher than their file size. Attempting to run an 8GB game on a device with only 4GB of RAM would likely result in performance issues or failure to run altogether due to insufficient memory. But, Virtual Memory: Your operating system uses virtual memory to compensate for limited RAM by temporarily storing data on disk. This allows you to run a 8GB game on a 4GB RAM system, but it may slow down performance due to frequent swapping between RAM and disk.

#### 140. What is starvation and aging in OS?
**Answer.** Starvation: Starvation occurs when a process is unable to proceed because it cannot access required resources, despite being eligible to do so. This situation can arise due to resource contention or scheduling algorithms favoring other processes excessively.

Aging: Aging is a technique used to prevent starvation in scheduling algorithms. It involves gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes over time, ensuring that all processes eventually get a chance to execute, even if they have been waiting for a long time.

#### 144. What is RAM ? What is a thread ? What is a Pthread ?
**Answer. RAM (Random Access Memory):** RAM is a type of computer memory that stores data and program instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. It is volatile memory, meaning that its contents are lost when the computer is powered off.

**Thread:** A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process they belong to but can execute independently, allowing for parallel execution of tasks within a program.

**Pthread:** Pthreads (POSIX threads) are a standardized thread API for Unix-like operating systems. They provide a set of functions for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads within a program, allowing developers to write portable multithreaded applications

#### 145. Can CPU goes beyond 100%?
**Answer.** No, the CPU cannot go beyond 100%. CPU usage percentages represent the proportion of time the CPU spends executing processes relative to its maximum capacity. Therefore, 100% CPU usage indicates that the CPU is fully utilized, and there are no additional processing resources available.

#### 146. How to install and use a software which need more space than the available space in your system ?
**Answer.** To install and use software that requires more space than available on your system, you can:

Free up disk space by removing unnecessary files or applications.
Use external storage devices such as USB drives or external hard drives to store additional data or install the software.
Consider upgrading your system's storage capacity by installing a larger hard drive or using cloud storage solutions.
But, alternative solutions such as using external storage devices or upgrading your system's storage capacity to accommodate the software.

#### 147. Difference between buffer and cache.
**Answer.** Buffer: A buffer temporarily stores data during input/output operations, typically to smooth out discrepancies in data transfer rates between devices.
Cache: A cache stores frequently accessed data or instructions to improve performance by reducing access latency. It holds copies of data from slower storage mediums, such as hard drives, in faster storage mediums, such as RAM or SSDs.

#### 148. Explain deadlock? How can we prevent it? Explain semaphores in layman language?
**Answer.** Deadlock: Deadlock is a situation in which two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource, resulting in a standstill. It can be prevented by using techniques such as resource ordering, deadlock detection, and avoidance algorithms.

Semaphores: Semaphores are synchronization mechanisms used to control access to shared resources in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment. They act like counters and can be used to manage access to resources by allowing only a certain number of threads or processes to access them simultaneously.

#### 149. Explain different page replacement algorithm, and which is the most efficient?
**Answer.** Page replacement algorithms manage memory in operating systems by selecting which page to evict from memory when a new page needs to be loaded. Some common algorithms include:

FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
LRU (Least Recently Used)
LFU (Least Frequently Used)
Optimal
The most efficient page replacement algorithm depends on the system's workload and characteristics. However, the Optimal algorithm, which selects the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future, is theoretically the most efficient but often impractical due to its requirement of future knowledge. LRU is widely used in practice and often performs well in a variety of scenarios.

#### 150. Can round-robin be pre-emptive?
**Answer.** Yes, Round-Robin scheduling can be pre-emptive. In a pre-emptive Round-Robin scheduling algorithm, the CPU time allocated to a process is divided into time slices, and if a process does not complete within its time slice, it is pre-empted (interrupted) and moved to the end of the ready queue to allow other processes to execute. This ensures fairness in CPU allocation and prevents any single process from monopolizing the CPU for an extended period.

#### 151. What is Active directory?
**Answer.** In Linux, a directory refers to a file system directory structure, which organizes files and directories hierarchically. It is not equivalent to Active Directory, which is a centralized directory service primarily used in Windows environments for managing network resources. In Linux, directory services may be provided by solutions such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or OpenLDAP.

#### 152. What is Bash? How would you explain Bash/PowerShell to a non-technical person?
**Answer.** Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a command-line shell and scripting language used in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It provides a text-based interface for interacting with the operating system, executing commands, and writing scripts to automate tasks.

To explain Bash/PowerShell to a non-technical person:

"Bash/PowerShell is like a digital assistant for your computer. It's a tool that lets you communicate with your computer using text commands instead of clicking buttons or icons. You can tell it to perform tasks like opening files, copying folders, or even writing programs, just by typing commands into a special window called a 'terminal' or 'command prompt'."

#### 153. 
**Answer.** 

#### 154. where are the USB drivers installed in Linux.

#### 157. Which directory are log files stored?
**Answer.** In Linux, log files are typically stored in the /var/log directory.

#### 158. A user says that whenever they try to use the system, it keeps rebooting, what could be the cause of this? How would you go about trying to find out what's causing the issue?
**Answer.** The cause of the system continuously rebooting could be due to various reasons such as hardware issues, software conflicts, or system errors. To diagnose the problem, you can start by checking the system logs for any error messages or clues about the rebooting behavior. Additionally, examining recent changes to hardware or software configurations and running diagnostic tests on hardware components can help identify the root cause of the issue.

#### 159. A client's system/server is having bad performance, what could potentially be causing this? How would you go about trying to find out the cause of this problem?
**Answer.** Poor system/server performance could be caused by factors such as insufficient hardware resources, software issues, network congestion, or improper configuration. To diagnose the problem, you can start by checking system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network) and reviewing system logs for error messages or performance-related issues. Additionally, monitoring network traffic and conducting performance tests can help identify bottlenecks and determine the root cause of the problem.

#### 160. If I have to run a management script in my system at a particular time each day, how will I proceed? What exactly goes inside cron jobs scripts?
**Answer.** To run a management script at a particular time each day, you can use cron, a built-in scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. You'll create a cron job by editing the crontab file using the crontab -e command and specifying the script to run and the desired schedule (e.g., daily at a specific time).

Cron jobs scripts typically contain commands or scripts to be executed at scheduled intervals. They can include shell commands, paths to scripts or programs, and any necessary parameters or options.

#### 161. when you use ping does it only check network connectivity or does it check connectivity on a specific port?
**Answer.** When you use the ping command, it only checks network connectivity at the IP layer using ICMP echo requests and replies. It does not check connectivity on a specific port. If you want to check connectivity on a specific port, you would use other tools such as telnet, nc, or curl.

#### 162. What if you want to check connectivity on a certain website on a specific port, for example. You do Ping google.com You get a response right? It means that you can communicate with Google as in your laptop from where you ran that command is communicating with google.com Just fine. However, if you want to communicate with Google, let's say on port 8080. How would you check connectivity for that?

#### or

#### Let's say you create a website. Just for example, right? It's your own website, where you know you put in details about your life and stuff. And it's hosted on, let's say www yourname.com. Write your name means that can.com That's fine. So when you pick that you get a response. We have been in this from your own laptop or computer whatever you use, right? It means okay connectivity is there however you want to communicate to your website on a specific port. For example, let the port number be 8080 How would you check connectivity with your website on port 8080 Like what one would use?
**Answer.** To check connectivity to a specific website on a specific port, such as port 8080 for Google, you can use tools like telnet, nc (netcat), or curl. For example: ```telnet google.com 8080``` or ```telnet yourname.com 8080```

This command attempts to establish a connection to Google on port 8080. If successful, it indicates that there is connectivity to Google on that port.

#### 163. Which Linux version you used in your project?
