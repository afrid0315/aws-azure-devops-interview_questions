## Kubernetes Interview Q/A

#### 1. How do you  automate Kubernetes deployment? 

**Answer**. I automate Kubernetes deployments through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for cluster provisioning. For application deployment, I use Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts, and CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI. This allows for version-controlled, repeatable, and consistent deployments, ensuring efficiency and reducing manual errors.

#### 2. What is exactly self healing in Kubernetes?

**Answer**. Self-healing in Kubernetes refers to the platform's ability to automatically detect and recover from failures or disruptions within the cluster. Kubernetes continuously monitors the desired state of applications and infrastructure. If it detects a discrepancy between the desired state and the current state, it takes corrective actions to reconcile them. This includes restarting failed containers, rescheduling pods to healthy nodes, and maintaining the desired number of replicas. Self-healing mechanisms contribute to the platform's robustness and resilience by minimizing downtime and ensuring that applications run reliably.

#### 3. Is Kubernetes portable? How?

**Answer**. Kubernetes is highly portable due to its architecture and design. It abstracts away infrastructure details, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments. Kubernetes achieves portability by using containerization (e.g., Docker) to encapsulate applications and their dependencies. Additionally, Kubernetes supports various cloud providers and on-premises environments, providing a consistent orchestration layer. This allows developers to build applications once and deploy them seamlessly across different infrastructures, promoting flexibility and reducing vendor lock-in

#### 4. We have pods? Why we use them?

**Answer**. We use pods in Kubernetes as the smallest deployable units that represent one or more containers closely coupled together. Containers within the same pod share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost. This allows for efficient communication and coordination between containers within a pod. However, for communication between different pods or services, companies typically use service discovery mechanisms provided by Kubernetes, and communication doesn't rely on localhost but rather on the ClusterIP service or other networking solutions

#### 5. How Kubernetes ensure the availability of applications?

**Answer**. Kubernetes ensures application availability through replication and scaling mechanisms, self-healing practices, and distribution of pod replicas across multiple nodes. Replication Controllers or Deployments maintain the desired number of pod replicas, allowing automatic recovery from failures. Kubernetes' self-healing continuously monitors and corrects discrepancies, while distribution across nodes and Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) further enhance resilience and scalability, ensuring applications are available and responsive.

#### 6. About replicaset?

**Answer**. A ReplicaSet in Kubernetes is a controller that ensures a specified number of identical replicas, or instances, of a pod are running at all times. It helps maintain the desired level of availability and scalability for applications. If a pod fails or needs to be scaled, the ReplicaSet automatically adjusts the number of replicas to match the specified configuration. ReplicaSets are a key component in achieving high availability and reliability within a Kubernetes cluster.(While we are going to use deployment.yml to actually create pod and in that yml file we give replicas, which is going to create that number of podes and if unfortunately pod deleted. This replicaset is going to auto-heal and create another pod.)

#### 7. Do you have any experience of upgrading the cluster? 

**Answer**. Yes, I have experience upgrading clusters. I follow a systematic approach, ensuring backups, checking compatibility, and performing rolling upgrades. I use tools like kubeadm or KOPS or Kubernetes-specific managed services to streamline the process. Continuous testing in non-production environments is a key practice to identify and address any potential issues before upgrading the production cluster.

#### 8. Clusters you are managing is self-hosted cluster or managed Kubernetes cluster?

**Answer**. Explain this answer as per you worked on it - I have experience managing both self-hosted and managed Kubernetes clusters. In certain environments, I've set up and configured self-hosted clusters, providing more customization control. Additionally, I've worked with managed Kubernetes services, such as Amazon EKS, where operational aspects are handled by the cloud provider, allowing a focus on application deployment and scalability.

#### 9. Any scaling experience in kubernetes?

**Answer**. Yes, I have experience with scaling applications in Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides both manual and automatic scaling options. For manual scaling, I've used the 'kubectl scale' command to adjust the number of replicas in a deployment based on demand. Additionally, I've implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), allowing Kubernetes to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on resource metrics or custom metrics. This ensures optimal resource utilization and responsiveness to changing workloads. Overall, my experience includes efficiently scaling applications in Kubernetes to meet performance and resource requirements.

#### 10. Explain Kubernetes architecture?

**Answer**. Kubernetes architecture consists of a Master Node - which consists of API server, Controller Manager, etcd (distributed key-value store) and Scheduler. 
Worker Node - which consists of Kubelet, Kube Proxy, and Container Runtime), Pods (basic units), Services (network abstraction), and Controllers (manage desired state). These components collaborate to automate containerized application deployment, scaling, and management in a distributed and scalable environment. 

For more detailed explaination -
Master Node:
- API Server: Serves as the entry point for all administrative tasks and communication with the cluster. It validates and configures data for the API objects, such as pods, services, and replication controllers.
- Controller Manager: Monitors the state of the cluster and responds to changes. It includes controller processes for nodes, replication, endpoints, and service accounts.
- Scheduler: Assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and other constraints.
- Etcd: A distributed key-value store that stores the configuration data of the cluster. This data represents the state of the cluster at any given point in time.

Worker Node:
- Kubelet: Ensures that containers are running on a node and communicates with the master to receive instructions.(Kubelet manages the container that are scheduled to run on that node. It ensure that containers are running and healthy, and that resources they need are available. Kubelet communicates with API server to get information about the containers that are running on node, and then starts and stops the containers as needed to maintain the desired state. It also monitors the containers to ensure the containers running correctly, restarts them if necessary.
- Kube Proxy: Maintains network rules on nodes. It manages network communication to and from a pod.
- Container Runtime: The software responsible for running containers. Common runtimes include Docker, containerd, and others.

Pod:
The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and consists of one or more containers that share the same network namespace.

Service:
An abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable communication between different sets of pods as if they were all part of a single application.

Namespace:
A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or applications. It provides a scope for names within the cluster.

Volume:
A directory accessible to all containers in a pod. It can be used to share data between containers and to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a pod.

Label:
A key-value pair that is attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are used to organize and select subsets of objects for various purposes.

Controller:
A control loop that watches the desired state of an object in the cluster and takes steps to move the current state closer to the desired state. Examples include ReplicaSets, Deployments, and StatefulSets.

Kubernetes components communicate with each other via the API server, and the etcd cluster ensures consistent and reliable storage of configuration data. This distributed architecture enables high availability, scalability, and resilience in managing containerized applications.

#### 11. About Network Policies?

**Answer**. Network Policies in Kubernetes are a set of rules that define how pods can communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. They provide a way to control the traffic flow at the pod level, allowing you to define ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic rules. Network Policies are particularly useful in microservices architectures, where controlling and securing communication between services is essential for overall application security and performance.
#### 12. What is config map?

**Answer**. A ConfigMap in Kubernetes is a resource that allows you to decouple configuration artifacts from pod specifications. It stores key-value pairs of configuration data, which can be consumed by pods as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files mounted into the pod's filesystem. ConfigMaps facilitate the separation of configuration concerns from application logic, promoting flexibility and manageability.

For example: When you have sensitive data such as database credentials or user passwords, it's not advisable to put them directly into your application's configuration files or Docker images, as this can pose a security risk. Instead, you can use Kubernetes ConfigMaps to store this sensitive information securely. By using ConfigMaps, you separate the sensitive configuration from your application code and Docker images, which helps improve security. Additionally, Kubernetes provides features such as encryption at rest for secrets, further enhancing the security of sensitive data stored in ConfigMaps or secrets.

#### 13. Do you have any idea about kubernetes service account?

**Answer**. Yes, Kubernetes service accounts are used to control and manage permissions for applications running in a Kubernetes cluster. Each pod can be associated with a service account, allowing it to interact with the Kubernetes API and access resources. Service accounts help implement the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions to pods. They play a crucial role in securing and managing access within the Kubernetes environment.

#### 14. Rolling update on kubernetes and how will you update?

**Answer**. A rolling update in Kubernetes involves updating a deployment without downtime by gradually replacing old replicas with new ones. I achieve this by adjusting the deployment's replica set, allowing a controlled rollout. I typically use the kubectl set image command or update the deployment YAML with the new image version. Kubernetes ensures a smooth transition by gradually replacing old pods with new ones, maintaining application availability throughout the update process.
(or) 
- Use Deployments: Employ Kubernetes Deployments for managing your application's lifecycle.
- Update Image Version: Modify the Deployment configuration with the new image version.
- Apply Changes: Use kubectl apply to update the configuration and trigger the rolling update.
- Monitor Progress: Keep an eye on the update progress with kubectl rollout status.
- Rollback (if necessary): If issues arise, perform a rollback with kubectl rollout undo.

#### 15. Can you differentiate between Kubernetes Jobs and Cron Jobs, and when would you use each?

**Answer**. Kubernetes Jobs are used for running tasks to completion, ensuring a specified number of completions. Cron Jobs, on the other hand, are used for running repetitive tasks on a schedule. Use Jobs for one-time or batch tasks, and Cron Jobs for recurring tasks, similar to cron jobs in Unix-like systems.

#### 16. As a kubernetes admin, if i ask to secure my kubernetes cluster and I do not have any information on it? How you will secure?

**Answer**. I will secure kubernetes cluster: 

        - By Role Based Access Control
        - By Network policies- it will control traffic between the pods.
        - By Secrets and conflicts - it will manage your sensitive information. (Use Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS)
        - By inspecting images by using tools like Snyk..
        - Run as a user not as Root(administrator)
        - etcd secure by firewalls

#### 17. What is minikube?

**Answer**. Minikube is a tool that enables developers to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally on their machines. It provides a lightweight and easy-to-set-up environment for testing and developing Kubernetes applications. Minikube allows you to experiment with Kubernetes features, deploy and manage applications in a local cluster, and gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes without the need for a full-scale, multi-node cluster. It's particularly useful for development, testing, and learning Kubernetes in a resource-constrained or offline environment.

#### 18. How to deploy a containerized application?

**Answer**. To deploy a containerized application:
- Create Docker Image: Package your application into a Docker image.
- Push Image to Registry: Push the Docker image to a container registry.
- Write Kubernetes Manifests: Create Kubernetes YAML files specifying deployment details.
- Apply Manifests: Use kubectl apply -f to deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Monitor and Scale: Monitor the application, and scale as needed using Kubernetes features like replicas and Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.

#### 19. How to deploy cluster deployment?

**Answer**. Create a YAML file specifying the deployment details, including container image, replicas, and any necessary configuration.
Use kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml to deploy the defined resources to the cluster. Monitor the deployment status with kubectl get deployments and kubectl get pods to ensure the desired number of replicas are running.

#### 20. What are the types of services within kubernetes?

**Answer**. There are three types of services in kubernetes that user can create.
- ClusterIp Mode
- Nodeport Mode
- LoadBalancer Mode

#### 21. What are Kubernetes commands? Give examples?

**Answer**. kubectl get pods: List all pods.
kubectl get services: List all services.
kubectl get deployments: List all deployments.
kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> --from-file=<path-to-file>: Create a ConfigMap.
kubectl cluster-info: Display cluster information.
kubectl get nodes: List all nodes in the cluster.

#### 22. What is Cluster in Kubernetes?

**Answer**. A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines, called nodes, that collectively run containerized applications orchestrated by Kubernetes. The cluster consists of a control plane that manages the cluster's state and a set of worker nodes where the actual application containers run. The control plane includes components such as the API server, controller manager, scheduler, and etcd, which store the cluster's configuration data. Worker nodes host the containers and run the kubelet, which communicates with the control plane. Kubernetes clusters provide scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of management for deploying and scaling containerized applications.

#### 23. What are container and components?

**Answer**. In the context of Kubernetes:
**Container**: A lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
**Components**: Refers to the various functional units within a Kubernetes cluster, such as the control plane components (API server, controller manager, scheduler), worker nodes, and add-ons like networking and storage plugins. These components collaborate to manage and run containerized applications.

#### 24. Why we use Kubernetes?

**Answer**. Kubernetes is used to automate and orchestrate containerized applications, providing a consistent and scalable platform. It simplifies deployment, scaling, and management tasks, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization. Kubernetes abstracts away infrastructure complexities, supports multi-cloud environments, and enhances developer productivity by promoting a declarative and self-healing approach to application deployment.
(kubernetes provides auto-healing, auto-scaling, managing multiple containers and having enterprise level support)
 
#### 25. Explain ClusterIp, Nodeport, LoadBalancer and ExternalName?

**Answer**. ClusterIP provides internal cluster communication, NodePort exposes on a static port for external access, LoadBalancer leverages cloud providers' load balancers for external traffic distribution, and ExternalName maps services to external DNS names. These service types cater to different use cases, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to various networking requirements

#### 26. What are the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?

**Answer**. Docker is a containerization platform that allows packaging and distributing applications along with their dependencies. It provides a standardized unit (container) for application deployment.

Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes orchestrates multiple Docker containers, ensuring their efficient operation, high availability, and scalability.(Kubernetes provide auto-healing, auto scaling, clustering and enterprise level support like load balancing).

In summary, Docker is for containerization, while Kubernetes is for container orchestration, providing a robust solution for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale.

#### 27. Have you ever used multiple containers within a single pod in Kubernetes? Provide an example.

**Answer**. Yes, I've used multiple containers within a single pod in Kubernetes. For instance, in a web application pod, I might have both a main application container and a sidecar container for log shipping. The containers share the same network namespace and storage, facilitating coordination and enhancing application functionality.

**Scenario you can explain**. Consider a web application that generates logs. You want to ship these logs to an external service for analysis. In this scenario, you could have a pod with two containers:
- Main Application Container:
Contains the primary web application that generates logs.
- Sidecar Container:
A separate container running a log shipping agent (e.g., Fluentd, Filebeat).
The sidecar container reads logs from the main application container, processes them, and sends them to a centralized logging service. 

#### 28. What is the role of kube-proxy?

**Answer**. Kube-proxy works by maintaining a set of network rules on each node in the cluster, which are updated dynamically as services added or removed. When a client sends request to a service, the request is intercepted by Kube-proxy on the node where it was received. Kube-proxy then looks up the destination endpoint for the service and routes the request accordingly.
 Kube-proxy is the essential component of a kubernetes cluster, as it ensures that services can communicate with each other.

#### 29. What is guestbook?

**Answer**. Guestbook is a simple, classic example application often used in Kubernetes tutorials and demos. It consists of a front-end service where users can leave messages, and a back-end service storing those messages. Guestbook showcases the deployment of a multi-tier application in Kubernetes, illustrating concepts like service discovery, scaling, and persistence.

#### 30. What is Kubectl?

**Answer**. kubectl is a command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot applications within a Kubernetes environment. With kubectl, you can perform tasks like deploying applications, managing pods and services, scaling deployments, and inspecting cluster resources. It's a crucial tool for Kubernetes administrators and developers working with containerized applications."

#### 31. Why should I go with kubernetes than Docker Swarm?

**Answer**. Kubernetes: Well-suited for large, complex, and multi-service applications. It provides a more extensive set of features, making it highly scalable and suitable for enterprise-level deployments.

Docker Swarm: Simpler and more lightweight, making it easier to set up and manage. It is suitable for smaller projects and environments with less complexity.

- Docker Swarm is not robust multicloud support as kubernetes.
- Kubernetes offers rolling updates, auto-scaling, sophisticated deployment strategies and advanced orchestration features compare to DockerSwarm.

#### 32. What is namespace?

**Answer**. In a kubernetes namespace is a logical isolation of resources, network policies, rbac and everything. For example, there are two projects using same k8s cluster. One project can use namespace1 and other project can use namespace2 without any overlap and authentication problems.

#### 33. What is the purpose of operators?

**Answer**. The purpose of operators in Kubernetes is to automate the management and operation of applications by encoding operational knowledge into software. Operators extend Kubernetes functionality to handle complex, stateful applications, providing a way to deploy, scale, and manage them more effectively through the use of custom controllers and automation scripts.

#### 34. How do you debug your pod or application or issues?

**Answer**. By using "kubectl describe pod <pod-name>". I get all the details of that pod and can debug accordingly. And also we have "kubectl logs <pod-name>" we get log details and can debug using those logs information.

#### 35. What is the difference between Docker container and Kubernetes pod?

**Answer**. A pod in kubernetes is a runtime specification of a container in docker. A pod provides more declarative way of defining using YAML and you can run more than one container in pod.

#### 36. What is ingress?

**Answer**. In Kubernetes, Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within the cluster. It acts as a layer 7 HTTP and HTTPS traffic router, providing rules for directing requests to the appropriate services based on paths, domains, and other criteria. Ingress enables more sophisticated routing and allows for centralized management of external access configurations.

#### 37. What is the difference between ingress and loadBalancer service type? Why they use ingress?

**Answer**. The key difference between Ingress and LoadBalancer service types in Kubernetes is that LoadBalancer provisions an external load balancer to expose a service, while Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services. Ingress provides additional capabilities such as path-based routing, SSL termination, and more, making it more versatile for managing HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It's preferred for complex routing scenarios and enables efficient use of resources by handling multiple services through a single external IP address.

#### 38. What about RBAC? 

**Answer**. RBAC, or Role-Based Access Control, in Kubernetes is a security mechanism to control access to resources. It defines roles and role bindings, allowing fine-grained permissions management. Roles specify what actions are allowed, and role bindings associate roles with users or groups. RBAC enhances security by restricting unauthorized access to sensitive operations and resources within the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 39. What is Helm?

**Answer**. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. It uses charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to define, install, and upgrade even complex applications. Helm streamlines the process of managing Kubernetes manifests, making it easier to share, version, and deploy applications consistently.

#### 40. When you create a new version of your Docker image, what steps do you follow?

**Answer**. Firstly, we create a docker file in that file we can make necessary code and enhancements. Add the version, build the image, test the image locally to ensure it works as expected then push it to Docker registry. Update Kubernetes manifests and deploy the updated application with the new image version to the target environment.

#### 41. Have you ever worked with horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) in Kubernetes? If so, how do you set it up?

**Answer**. I ensure the Kubernetes Metrics Server is deployed in the cluster to collect resource usage metrics. For pods, I configure them to expose resource metrics, such as CPU or memory usage. I create an HPA (HorizontalPodAutoscaler) resource, specifying the target metrics (e.g., CPU) and scaling parameters, like the minimum and maximum number of replicas. For example hpa.yml is
```
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      targetAverageUtilization: 70
```
After defining the HPA, I apply it to the cluster using kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml. This setup allows Kubernetes to automatically adjust the number of pod replicas based on resource metrics, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization for the application.

#### 42. Explain the purpose of persistent storage in Kubernetes and why it's needed.

**Answer**. Persistent storage in Kubernetes is crucial for preserving data beyond the lifecycle of individual pods. It ensures that data persists even if a pod or node fails, enabling stateful applications. Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) simplify storage management by abstracting underlying storage details, providing dynamic provisioning, and facilitating easier scaling and data persistence for applications.

#### 43. Describe a scenario where you would use Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in Kubernetes.

**Answer**. I would use Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in Kubernetes when deploying a stateful application, such as a database. PVs represent physical storage resources, and PVCs act as a request for storage by the application. This ensures data persistence and allows the application to retain state even if the underlying pods are rescheduled or restarted. PVs and PVCs provide a way to dynamically provision and manage storage for stateful workloads in a scalable and reliable manner.

#### 44. How do you manage secrets in your Kubernetes project, and what role does Kubernetes Secret play?

**Answer**. In my Kubernetes project, I manage secrets using Kubernetes Secrets, a built-in resource for securely storing sensitive information like API keys or passwords. Kubernetes Secrets encode and store these values, ensuring they are not exposed in plaintext within the cluster. I reference secrets in pod specifications, either mounting them as files or exposing them as environment variables, to securely provide confidential data to applications running in the cluster.

#### 45. Can you explain a scenario where you would use a service mesh in Kubernetes, especially in terms of authentication and authorization?

**Answer**. I would use a service mesh in Kubernetes, such as Istio, in scenarios where I need to enhance communication between microservices. Specifically, for authentication and authorization, a service mesh provides capabilities like mutual TLS for secure communication, fine-grained access control, and user identity propagation. This ensures that only authorized services can communicate securely within the cluster, improving overall security and governance." (Mutual TLS between services like microservice to microservice communication)

#### 46. Why are Pod Security Policies important in Kubernetes, and how would you implement them to enhance security?

**Answer**. Pod Security Policies (PSPs) are crucial in Kubernetes to enforce security measures for pods. They define the security context under which pods run, mitigating risks. To implement PSPs, you define policies specifying allowed actions and restrictions, ensuring pods adhere to security standards. This enhances security by preventing unauthorized access, minimizing privileges, and promoting a secure container runtime environment.
- To enhance security with Pod Security Policies (PSPs) in Kubernetes, I would:
- Define PSPs: Specify security policies detailing pod behavior.
- Enable Admission Controller: Activate the PodSecurity admission controller to enforce PSPs.
- Create RoleBindings: Associate PSPs with Kubernetes roles to apply policies to namespaces or clusters.
- Review and Adjust: Regularly audit and adjust PSPs based on security requirements and application needs.
- Educate Users: Ensure users understand and follow security best practices when deploying pods to maintain a secure environment.
  
#### 47. Do you work with resource limits and resource quotas in your Kubernetes setup? If yes, how do you set them up?

**Answer**. Yes, in my Kubernetes setup, I utilize resource limits and quotas for effective resource management. To set them up, I define resource limits in pod specifications to restrict CPU and memory usage. For resource quotas, I create a ResourceQuota object in the desired namespace, specifying limits for CPU, memory, and other resources. This helps prevent resource overuse and ensures fair resource distribution among applications within the cluster.

#### 48. How would you implement horizontal pod scaling based on custom metrics specific to your application's performance indicators?

**Answer**. To implement horizontal pod scaling based on custom metrics in Kubernetes, I would follow these steps:
- Install a Metrics Provider: Deploy and configure a custom metrics provider like Prometheus or Datadog to collect application-specific metrics.
- Define a Custom Metrics API: Expose custom metrics in a format compatible with the Kubernetes Custom Metrics API.
- Set Up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Create an HPA resource, specifying the custom metric and target value for scaling.
```
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  metrics:
  - type: External
    external:
      metricName: custom.metric/name
      targetValue: 100
```
- Apply Configurations: Apply the configurations to the cluster using kubectl apply -f.
This setup allows Kubernetes to dynamically adjust the number of pod replicas based on your application-specific performance metrics.

#### 49. Explain a scenario where pod priority and premption in Kubernetes would be useful, and have you ever implemented this?

**Answer**. Pod priority and preemption in Kubernetes are useful in scenarios where certain pods, such as critical services, need preferential treatment during resource allocation. For example, a critical production service might be assigned a higher priority to ensure it gets resources over less critical background tasks. While I haven't implemented this directly, understanding the concept is crucial for optimizing resource allocation in Kubernetes.

#### 50. In what situations would you use StatefulSets in Kubernetes, and what benefits do they offer over Deployments?

**Answer**. I would use StatefulSets in Kubernetes for stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage. StatefulSets provide ordered and unique pod identifiers, ensuring predictable hostnames and persistent volumes for each replica. This is beneficial for databases, distributed systems, or applications with specific node dependencies. StatefulSets offer stronger guarantees for stateful workload orchestration compared to Deployments.

#### 51. How can you change the number of replicas for a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes, and what should you check for if the replicas are not scaling as expected?

**Answer**. To change the number of replicas for a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes, you can edit the replicas field in the ReplicaSet's YAML or you can use the kubectl scale command. For example:.
```
kubectl scale replicasets my-replicaset --replicas=3
```
If replicas are not scaling as expected, check for issues such as resource constraints, unsatisfied PodDisruptionBudget, or problems with the underlying container runtime.

#### 52. Can you explain the ingress controller routing mechanism?

**Answer**. The Ingress controller manages external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster. It uses rules and configurations to route incoming traffic to the appropriate services based on criteria such as hostnames, paths, or other attributes. This routing mechanism allows for efficient and flexible traffic management, enabling the cluster to handle external requests and distribute them to the relevant services within.

#### 53. Kubernetes commands?
**Answer**. 
```
kubectl apply -f httpd-deploy

kubectl rollout history deployment/httpd-deploy --namespace=xfusion
```

#### 54. How to increase node in eks?
**Answer.** Increasing Nodes in EKS:

Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Adjust the desired capacity of the ASG associated with the EKS node group.

AWS Console: Navigate to the EKS console, select the node group, and modify the desired capacity.

AWS CLI: Use the eks update-nodegroup-version command to modify the node group capacity.

HCL Configuration: If using Terraform or other Infrastructure as Code tools, update the configuration file and apply the changes.

Verification: Ensure that the new nodes are added to the EKS cluster, and monitor cluster health after scaling.

#### 55. Why it’s using v1/apps in service file in kubernetes?
**Answer.** The use of v1/apps in a Kubernetes deployment file indicates the API version and resource type being used. In the context of Kubernetes definitions, v1 refers to the core API version, and apps refers to the resource type, which typically relates to applications.

#### 56. Can we have multiple conatiners in a pod? Can we have similar conatiners in a pod? Lets say i have 4 conatiners, one of them has failed how would you check which container has failed?
**Answer.** Yes, multiple containers can be in a single pod in Kubernetes. These containers share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost.

Yes, it is possible to have similar containers in a pod.

To check which container has failed in a pod with multiple containers, you can use the following command:
```
kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
```
Look for the Events section, and it will provide details about the status and events related to each container within the pod, helping you identify the one that has failed.

#### 57. What is liveness and readiness probe? Why we need them?
**Answer.** 
Liveness Probe:

Definition: A liveness probe is a mechanism to determine if a container is running and healthy.
Purpose: Ensures that the application inside the container is responsive and prevents routing traffic to unhealthy instances.
Readiness Probe:

Definition: A readiness probe checks if a container is ready to accept traffic.
Purpose: Ensures that the container is fully initialized and ready to serve requests before being included in the pool of service instances.
Why We Need Them:

Liveness Probe:

Prevents routing traffic to containers that are unresponsive or in a faulty state.
Ensures the continuous availability and health of the application.
Readiness Probe:

Ensures smooth traffic transitions during updates or scaling by letting Kubernetes know when a container is ready to serve requests.
Enhances the reliability and stability of a service by avoiding premature traffic to containers that might still be initializing.
Overall, liveness and readiness probes contribute to the robustness and reliability of applications in a containerized environment.

#### 58. Have you worked on kubernetes monitoring? Which tools you have used?
**Answer.** Yes, I have experience with Kubernetes monitoring. I have used tools such as:

Prometheus: For collecting and querying metrics from Kubernetes clusters.
Grafana: Used in conjunction with Prometheus for visualization and dashboard creation.
Kube-state-metrics: Provides additional Kubernetes-specific metrics for better insights.
Alertmanager: Integrated with Prometheus for alerting based on defined rules.
Kubernetes Dashboard: For a graphical interface to monitor cluster resources and activities.
These tools collectively offer comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and visualization capabilities for Kubernetes environments.

#### 59. Can we deploy a pod on particular node??
**Answer.** Yes, we can deploy a pod on a particular node in Kubernetes by using node affinity or node selectors. These mechanisms allow specifying constraints to influence pod placement, ensuring that the pod runs on a node with specific attributes or labels.

#### 60. Workload in Kubernetes?
**Answer.** Workload in Kubernetes:

- Definition: Refers to the application components or processes running on a Kubernetes cluster.

- Types: Common workloads include Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and Jobs, each serving specific application requirements.

- Management: Kubernetes workloads are managed using declarative configurations, enabling scalability, resilience, and ease of deployment.

#### 61. Kuberntes cost optimisation?
**Answer.** Kubernetes Cost Optimization:

Right-sizing: Adjust resource requests and limits for pods to match actual usage.

Auto-scaling: Dynamically scale the number of pods based on demand to avoid overprovisioning.

Resource Quotas: Enforce limits on resources consumed by namespaces to prevent resource sprawl.

Node Pools: Use different node pools with varied instance types based on workload requirements.

Pod Disruption Budgets: Control the number of simultaneous pod disruptions during updates to maintain stability.

Monitoring and Alerts: Implement monitoring to identify inefficiencies and set up alerts for cost-related anomalies.

#### 62. What is Kubernetes networking, and how does it work?
**Answer. Kubernetes Networking:** 
Kubernetes networking is the set of principles and components enabling communication between pods, services, and external entities in a Kubernetes cluster.

#### 63. What is a pod IP, and how is it used in Kubernetes networking?
**Answer. Pod IP in Kubernetes Networking:**
A Pod IP is a unique internal IP address assigned to a pod, allowing communication within the cluster.

#### 64. What is a node port, and how is it used in Kubernetes networking?
**Answer.** Node Port is a Kubernetes service type that exposes a service on a static port on each node, enabling external access.

#### 65. How does Kubernetes handle load balancing for services?
**Answer.** Kubernetes uses kube-proxy to handle load balancing for services, distributing traffic across healthy pods.

#### 66. What is a network policy, and how is it used in Kubernetes networking?
**Answer.**  Network Policy is a Kubernetes resource defining rules for pod-to-pod communication, allowing or restricting traffic.

#### 67. What is the difference between a Kubernetes Service and a Kubernetes Ingress?
**Answer.** Service: Routes traffic within the cluster based on service IPs.
Ingress: Manages external access, handling HTTP and HTTPS traffic and allowing more advanced routing.

#### 68. What is a Kubernetes ExternalName service, and how is it used in networking?
**Answer.**  ExternalName service maps a Kubernetes service to a DNS name, facilitating external resource access.

#### 69. What is the difference between a Layer 4 load balancer and a Layer 7 load balancer, and which one is better for Kubernetes?
**Answer.** 
Layer 4: Operates at the transport layer, handling IP and port information.
Layer 7: Works at the application layer, considering content and making routing decisions based on HTTP attributes.

#### 70. How does Kubernetes integrate with cloud-based load balancers, such as AWS ELB or Google Cloud Load Balancing?
**Answer.** Integration: Kubernetes integrates with cloud-based load balancers, leveraging services like AWS ELB or Google Cloud Load Balancing for external access.

#### 71. What is the difference between a Kubernetes ClusterIP service and a Kubernetes NodePort service?
**Answer.** 
ClusterIP: Exposes a service only within the cluster.
NodePort: Exposes a service on a static port on each node, allowing external access.

#### 72. What is a Kubernetes Headless service, and how is it used in networking?
**Answer.** A Headless service in Kubernetes doesn't assign a Cluster IP, providing a stable network identity for pods but without load balancing. (or) A Kubernetes Headless Service is a type of Service that doesn't assign a ClusterIP to its Pods. Instead, it allows direct communication with individual Pods via their IP addresses. It's useful for scenarios such as StatefulSets, where stable network identities for Pods are required, or for enabling peer-to-peer communication. Clients resolve the Service's DNS name to a list of individual Pod IP addresses for direct communication.

#### 73. Difference between Node and Pod?
**Answer.** Node: A node is a physical or virtual machine within a Kubernetes cluster. It provides resources and runs Kubernetes services.

Pod: A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more tightly coupled containers. Pods share resources and networking context. They run on nodes.

#### 74. What is pod, how many containers we can run in single pods, any limitations?
**Answer.** A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing one or more containers that are deployed together on the same host.
- A single Pod can contain one or more containers, typically related and tightly coupled, that share networking and storage resources.
- While there is no strict limit on the number of containers within a single Pod, it's generally recommended to keep Pods focused on a single concern or tightly coupled set of concerns for better maintainability and scalability.

#### 75. Different deployment strategies one can take when they're deploying any application, or, you know, virtual machines or containers or anything like that?
**Answer.** Different deployment strategies include:

Blue-Green Deployment: Running two identical production environments, with one serving live traffic (blue) while the other is idle (green). The green environment is updated with new changes, tested, and then swapped with the blue environment to minimize downtime.

Canary Deployment: Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users or servers before deploying them to the entire infrastructure. This allows for testing in a real-world environment and mitigates the risk of widespread issues. (We have two identical environments v1 and v2-version2. We slowly test v2 by deploying few users like 10% and remaining 90% in v1, after v2 running fine all other 90% also we deploy in v2).

Rolling Deployment: Deploying changes gradually across a pool of servers or instances, one at a time, while ensuring the application remains available throughout the process. This strategy helps minimize downtime and allows for quick rollback if issues arise.

Immutable Deployment: Deploying changes by replacing the entire infrastructure with a new, immutable version. This ensures consistency and reproducibility but may involve longer deployment times and increased resource usage.

Feature Flags: Deploying changes but controlling their activation using feature flags. This allows for gradual feature rollout, testing, and experimentation without deploying multiple versions of the application.

Each deployment strategy has its own advantages and considerations, and the choice depends on factors such as the application's architecture, requirements, and risk tolerance.

#### 76. Kubectl means?
**Answer.** Kubecontrol.

#### 77. About taint and tolerations in kubernetes?
**Answer.** In Kubernetes, taints are used to repel pods from nodes, while tolerations allow pods to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints. They're mechanisms for controlling pod placement in the cluster.

#### 78. About static pod and normal pod?
**Answer.** Static pods are managed directly by the kubelet on a node, while normal pods are managed by the Kubernetes API server. Static pods are typically used for system components like kube-proxy or kubelet itself, whereas normal pods are deployed through Kubernetes manifests and managed by controllers like Deployments or StatefulSets. (Static pod cannot be deleted like normal pod - k delete pod. We need to delete by going into the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ path and need to delete.)

#### 79. About daemonset?
**Answer.** DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod. It's used for background tasks like log collection or node monitoring where each node in the cluster needs a copy of the pod.

#### 80. What is the path of directory holding static pod definition files?
**Answer.** path is cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests/

#### 81. From where are we retrieving logs in Kubernetes and where can we locate the log paths?
**Answer.** In Kubernetes, logs are typically retrieved directly from the containers running inside pods. The path to the logs depends on how the application inside the container is configured to output its logs. Generally, logs are accessed via the container runtime interface or through logging agents like Fluentd or Fluent Bit.

#### 82. kubernetes can we have backup?
**Answer.** Yes, Kubernetes supports backups. You can back up Kubernetes resources and persistent data using tools like:

1. **Velero**: A popular open-source tool for backing up and restoring Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes.
2. **ETCD Backup**: For clusters using ETCD as the data store, you can back up ETCD directly.
3. **Persistent Volume Snapshots**: Use Kubernetes VolumeSnapshots to create snapshots of persistent volumes.

These methods ensure you can recover your Kubernetes cluster and data in case of failures or data loss.

#### 83. If private cluster? How can you access?
**Answer.**  az aks command invoke command is useful for accessing an AKS cluster without needing to configure kubectl locally. It simplifies access, enhances security, supports audit logging, and integrates well with automation workflows.
```
az aks command invoke --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --command 'kubectl get nodes'
```
#### 84. About Daemonset?
**Answer.** In Kubernetes ensure that a specific pod runs on all or a subset of nodes in the cluster, making them ideal for deploying system-level daemons or background services uniformly across the infrastructure. They handle automatic scheduling, support rolling updates, and are used for tasks like monitoring agents, logging collectors, or network proxies that require presence on every node.

#### 85. About affinity, anti-affinity, taints/tolerations and node selectors/affinity differences?
**Answer.** While **Affinity and Anti-Affinity**, **Taints and Tolerations**, and **Node Selectors and Node Affinity** all serve to control pod placement within a Kubernetes cluster, they have distinct use cases, flexibility levels, and mechanisms for achieving pod scheduling constraints. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. Node Selectors vs. Node Affinity

- **Node Selectors**:
  - **Simplicity**: Node selectors are a simple key-value pair mechanism.
  - **Usage**: Used to specify that a pod should only be scheduled on nodes with specific labels.
  - **Example**:
    ```yaml
    nodeSelector:
      disktype: ssd
    ```
  - **Limitations**: Less flexible and powerful compared to node affinity.

- **Node Affinity**:
  - **Flexibility**: Provides more advanced rules for node selection, allowing for expressions like `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`, and ranges for numeric values.
  - **Usage**: Used for more complex node selection logic.
  - **Example**:
    ```yaml
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: disktype
              operator: In
              values:
              - ssd
    ```
  - **Benefits**: More expressive, allowing for both required and preferred node affinity rules.

### 2. Taints and Tolerations vs. Affinity/Anti-Affinity

- **Taints and Tolerations**:
  - **Purpose**: Taints are applied to nodes to repel pods unless they tolerate the taint.
  - **Mechanism**: Taints are key-value pairs with an effect (`NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, `NoExecute`).
  - **Example**:
    ```yaml
    taints:
    - key: "example.com/special-feature"
      value: "true"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
    ```
    ```yaml
    tolerations:
    - key: "example.com/special-feature"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "true"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
    ```

- **Affinity/Anti-Affinity**:
  - **Purpose**: Used to specify rules for co-locating or avoiding specific pods on certain nodes.
  - **Mechanism**: Defines rules based on pod or node labels for scheduling preferences.
  - **Example** (Pod Affinity):
    ```yaml
    affinity:
      podAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: "app"
              operator: In
              values:
              - frontend
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
    ```

### 3. Key Differences

- **Complexity**:
  - **Node Selectors**: Simple and straightforward, ideal for basic node filtering.
  - **Node Affinity**: More complex and powerful, suitable for more nuanced node selection criteria.
  - **Taints and Tolerations**: Enforce a policy to repel or allow pods on nodes based on conditions.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Node Selectors**: Best for basic constraints, such as requiring a specific hardware type.
  - **Node Affinity**: Best for more complex scheduling logic, like specifying multiple conditions or priorities.
  - **Taints and Tolerations**: Ideal for ensuring that certain workloads only run on nodes with specific features or conditions, or to avoid resource contention.

- **Interaction**:
  - **Node Selectors** and **Node Affinity**: Can be used together with taints and tolerations but serve different purposes. Node selectors and affinity focus on node selection, while taints and tolerations control pod placement based on node characteristics.

**Answer.** Web applications (e.g., Java Spring Boot, Node.js), microservices architectures, databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB), message brokers (e.g., Apache Kafka), monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana), CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins), and containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.

#### 88. How have you injected the secrets in ConfigMaps?
**Answer.** Secrets should not be injected in ConfigMaps as ConfigMaps are not designed for
sensitive data. Instead, Kubernetes Secrets should be used. Secrets can be injected into
pods via environment variables or mounted as files.

#### 89. How do you find which pod is taking more system resources across nodes using kubectl?
**Answer.** Use kubectl top pod --all-namespaces to list resource usage by pods.
Combine it with kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to get detailed resource usage.

#### 90. Types or design patterns of containers we have in kubernetes?
**Answer.** 
| **Pattern**          | **Purpose**                                      | **Example**                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |

5. How do you know which worker node is consuming more resources across
the clusters using kubectl?
● Answer: Use kubectl top nodes to see resource consumption across nodes. This will
show CPU and memory usage on each node.

6. What are the steps for configuring Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
Kubernetes clusters?
● Answer:
1. Deploy Prometheus using Helm or a custom YAML configuration.
2. Set up Kubernetes service discovery for Prometheus.
3. Deploy Grafana and configure it to use Prometheus as a data source.
4. Import Kubernetes monitoring dashboards in Grafana.
5. Set up alerting rules in Prometheus as needed.

7. If 20 pods are running, how do you visualize the metrics of these pods in
Grafana?
● Answer: Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as the data source. Use existing Kubernetes
dashboards or create custom dashboards to visualize metrics for all pods.

7. What is Apache Kafka?
● Answer: Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time
data pipelines and streaming applications. It’s designed to handle large volumes of data in a
distributed, fault-tolerant manner.

8. How do you set up a Docker Hub private registry and integrate it with a CI/CD
pipeline? What is the procedure?
● Answer:
1. Create a private repository on Docker Hub.
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline to authenticate with Docker Hub using credentials.
3. Build Docker images in CI pipeline and push them to the private repository.
4. Pull images from the private registry during the CD process.

10. What is the use of the break command in shell scripting? In what scenarios
have you used it?
- **Answer:** The `break` command is used to exit a loop prematurely. It is commonly used when
a specific condition is met, and you no longer need to continue the loop.

11. How do you count the number of "devops" words in 15 HTML files?
To count the number of times the word "devops" appears across 15 HTML files, you can use the
following shell command:
grep -o -i "devops" *.html | wc -l
Explanation:
● grep -o -i "devops" *.html: Searches for the word "devops" (case-insensitive due to
-i) in all HTML files and outputs each occurrence on a new line (-o).
● wc -l: Counts the number of lines output by grep, which corresponds to the number of
occurrences of "devops".

12. What is the terraform taint command?
The terraform taint command is used to manually mark a specific resource for recreation
during the next terraform apply. When a resource is tainted, Terraform will destroy it and create
a new instance of it on the next apply. This is useful when you know a resource needs to be replaced
but Terraform hasn't automatically determined that it should be.
Syntax: terraform taint <resource_address>
Example: terraform taint aws_instance.example

13. What are the possible ways to secure a state file in Terraform?
1. Encrypt the State File: Store the state file in an encrypted format using tools like AWS S3
bucket encryption, Azure Blob encryption, or Google Cloud Storage encryption.
2. Use Remote Backends with Security Controls: Use a remote backend like AWS S3 with IAM
roles and policies, HashiCorp Consul with ACLs, or Terraform Cloud, which manages access
control and encryption.
3. Enable Versioning: Use versioning on the state file storage to recover from any unintended
changes or deletions.
4. Access Control: Restrict access to the state file using IAM policies, RBAC (Role-Based
Access Control), or similar mechanisms.
5. Use Backend Locking: Use state locking mechanisms provided by backends like S3 with
DynamoDB or Consul to prevent concurrent operations from corrupting the state file.

14. If you provision 100 servers and someone deletes 50 VMs manually, what
happens if you apply the terraform apply command?
When you run terraform apply, Terraform will compare the state file with the actual
infrastructure. It will notice that 50 VMs are missing and will attempt to recreate those missing VMs
to match the state defined in your configuration. The end result will be 100 VMs again.

15. What is the syntax for for_each in Terraform?
The for_each meta-argument in Terraform allows you to create multiple instances of a resource or
module based on the items in a map or set. The syntax is as follows:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
 for_each = var.instances
 ami = each.value["ami"]
 instance_type = each.value["instance_type"]
 tags = {
 Name = each.key
 }
}
In this example, var.instances is a map, and each.key refers to the current key in the map,
while each.value refers to the associated value.

16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of multi-stage builds in
Docker?
Advantages:
● Smaller Image Size: By separating the build environment from the runtime environment, only
the necessary components are included in the final image, leading to smaller image sizes.
● Improved Security: Reduces the attack surface by excluding build tools and other
unnecessary components from the final image.
● Better Caching: Allows for more efficient use of Docker’s caching mechanism, potentially
speeding up the build process.
● Separation of Concerns: Different stages can focus on specific tasks, making the Dockerfile
more organized and easier to maintain.
Disadvantages:
● Complexity: Multi-stage Dockerfiles can be more complex and harder to understand,
especially for those new to Docker.
● Longer Build Times: In some cases, the use of multiple stages may lead to longer build
times due to additional steps and transitions between stages.
● Troubleshooting: Debugging and troubleshooting can be more challenging because
intermediate stages are not preserved by default.

17. How do you deploy containers on different hosts, not the same host, within
a Docker cluster?
To deploy containers on different hosts within a Docker cluster, you can use Docker Swarm or
Kubernetes:
● Docker Swarm: Use Docker Swarm’s built-in orchestration capabilities. When deploying a
service, Swarm will automatically distribute the containers across different nodes in the
cluster. You can influence this behavior using placement constraints.
Example:
docker service create --name myservice --replicas 2 --constraint 'node.role == worker' myimage
Kubernetes: Use Kubernetes, which will schedule pods on different nodes based on the available
resources and any specified node selectors or affinities.

18. If you have a Docker Compose setup, how do you deploy the web container
on one host and the DB container on another host?
To deploy the web container on one host and the DB container on another using Docker Compose,
you can:
1. Use Docker Swarm: Convert the Compose file into a stack file, and deploy it with docker
stack deploy. Docker Swarm will distribute services across nodes.
2. Manual Placement: Use placement constraints in your docker-compose.yml file to
specify which containers should run on which nodes.
version: '3.7'
services:
 web:
 image: my-web-image
 deploy:
 placement:
 constraints: [node.hostname == web-node]
 db:
 image: my-db-image
 deploy:
 placement:
 constraints: [node.hostname == db-node]

19. What is the difference between bridge networking and host networking in
Docker?
● Bridge Networking: The default Docker network driver. Containers connected to the same
bridge network can communicate with each other. Each container gets its own IP address
and is isolated from the host network. You can expose ports to the host using the -p option.
● Host Networking: The container shares the host's network stack, meaning it doesn’t get its
own IP address, and the container's network is the same as the host's network. This can lead
to performance improvements but reduces isolation between the host and the container.

20. How do you resolve merge conflicts?
To resolve merge conflicts, follow these steps:
1. Identify the Conflict: Git will mark the conflicting areas in the files with conflict markers
(<<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>).
2. Manually Resolve: Open the conflicting file and decide how to combine the changes.
Remove the conflict markers and modify the content to resolve the conflict.
3. Stage the Resolved Files: Once resolved, stage the files using git add.
4. Commit the Changes: Commit the resolved conflicts with git commit. If you were in the
middle of a merge, this will complete the merge process.
5. Test: Run tests to ensure that the merge didn’t introduce any issues.
Example:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts in X, Y, Z files"

21. What command do you use to change the existing commit message?
To change the most recent commit message, you can use the following Git command:
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
If you have already pushed the commit to a remote repository, you will need to force push the
changes:
git push --force

22. What is session affinity?
Session affinity, also known as sticky sessions, is a concept in load balancing where requests from a
particular user are consistently directed to the same server (or pod) in a multi-server environment.
This ensures that the user's session data, which might be stored locally on the server, remains
accessible throughout the session.

23. What is pod affinity and its use case?
Pod affinity is a feature in Kubernetes that allows you to specify rules for scheduling pods to run on
nodes that have other specified pods running on them. This can be useful when you want certain
pods to be located together due to factors like data locality, network latency, or shared resources.
Use Case: An application where the frontend and backend services communicate frequently might
use pod affinity to ensure that both are scheduled on the same node to reduce network latency.

24. What is the difference between pod affinity and pod anti-affinity?
● Pod Affinity: Ensures that pods are scheduled on the same node or in proximity to each
other.
● Pod Anti-Affinity: Ensures that pods are not scheduled on the same node or are placed far
apart from each other.
Example Use Case:
● Pod Affinity: Running frontend and backend on the same node for low-latency
communication.
● Pod Anti-Affinity: Ensuring replicas of the same application are spread across different
nodes to increase availability and fault tolerance.

25. What are readiness and liveness probes?
● Readiness Probe: Used to determine when a pod is ready to start accepting traffic. If the
readiness probe fails, the pod will be removed from the service endpoints, ensuring it does
not receive traffic until it's ready.
● Liveness Probe: Used to determine if a pod is still running. If the liveness probe fails,
Kubernetes will restart the pod, assuming it's in a failed state.

26. Write a simple Groovy pipeline for a Java Spring Boot application that waits
for user input for approval to move to the next stage, with stages for checkout,
build, push, and deploy.
pipeline {
 agent any
 stages {
 stage('Checkout') {
 steps {
 git 'https://github.com/your-repo/java-spring-boot-app.git'
 }
 }
 stage('Build') {
 steps {
 sh './mvnw clean package'
 }
 }
 stage('Push') {
 steps {
 sh 'docker build -t your-docker-repo/java-spring-boot-app .'
 sh 'docker push your-docker-repo/java-spring-boot-app'
}
 }
 stage('Approval') {
 steps {
 input 'Do you want to deploy to production?'
 }
 }
 stage('Deploy') {
 steps {
 sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
 }
 }
 }
}

27. How do you export test reports in Jenkins?
To export test reports in Jenkins:
1. Ensure that your tests generate reports in a standard format like JUnit XML or HTML.
2. Use the Publish JUnit test result report post-build action to archive test reports.
3. You can also use the Archive the artifacts post-build action to store other types of reports.
4. The test reports can then be accessed and downloaded from the Jenkins build page.

28. If 5 pods are running, how do you scale the number of pods to 10 using the
command line in Kubernetes?
To scale the number of pods from 5 to 10, use the following command:
kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment/<your-deployment-name>

29. Can you explain the usage of the terraform import command?
The terraform import command is used to import existing infrastructure resources into
Terraform's state file, allowing Terraform to manage them. This is particularly useful when you want
to bring existing infrastructure under Terraform management without having to recreate resources.
terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <resource_id>
Example:
terraform import aws_instance.my_instance i-1234567890abcdef0

30. In AWS, where do you store the state file, and how do you manage it?
In AWS, Terraform state files are typically stored in an S3 bucket, and the state can be managed
using a combination of S3 and DynamoDB for locking.
Example Configuration:
terraform {
 backend "s3" {
 bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
 key = "path/to/my/terraform.tfstate"
 region = "us-west-2"
 dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
encrypt = true
 }
}
Management:
● S3: Stores the state file securely, supports versioning, and can be encrypted.
● DynamoDB: Provides locking to prevent multiple simultaneous operations on the same state
file, avoiding conflicts.
This setup ensures that your Terraform state is stored securely and is protected from simultaneous
access issues.

31. What is the biggest issue you have faced with Terraform, and how did you resolve it?
● One significant issue I faced was managing Terraform state when multiple teams were
working on the same infrastructure. This was resolved by organizing the infrastructure into
separate modules and using remote state management with proper locking mechanisms.

32. What are the types of storage accounts in AWS S3?
● In AWS S3, the different storage classes include:
○ S3 Standard
○ S3 Intelligent-Tiering
○ S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
○ S3 One Zone-IA
○ S3 Glacier
○ S3 Glacier Deep Archive

33. Are you familiar with lifecycle management in S3 buckets? How do you set up lifecycle
policies?
● Yes, lifecycle management in S3 allows you to define rules to transition objects between
different storage classes or delete them after a certain period. Lifecycle policies can be set
up using the S3 Management Console, AWS CLI, or Terraform by specifying the transitions
and expiration actions in a JSON configuration file.

34. What are the differences between load balancers, and why do we need them?
● Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers. The main types
are:
○ Application Load Balancer (ALB): Operates at the application layer (Layer 7), and is
used for HTTP/HTTPS traffic with advanced routing capabilities.
○ Network Load Balancer (NLB): Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is used
for ultra-low latency TCP/UDP traffic.
○ Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Supports both Layer 4 and Layer 7, but is now mostly
deprecated in favor of ALB and NLB.
● Load balancers improve fault tolerance, scalability, and ensure high availability.

35. Have you worked with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)?
● Yes, I have worked with ASGs to automatically scale the number of instances in response to
demand. ASGs are configured with policies that adjust the desired capacity based on
metrics such as CPU utilization, helping to maintain application performance and optimize
costs.

36. Can you write a simple Dockerfile?
Yes, here is a simple example of a Dockerfile for a Node.js application:
Dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]

37. If you want to expose your application to the public internet or access your application within a
cluster, how would you do that in Kubernetes?
● To expose your application to the public internet, you can use a Kubernetes Service of type
LoadBalancer or NodePort. For internal access within the cluster, you can use a 
ClusterIP service. Additionally, you might use an Ingress controller for more advanced
routing.

38. Why do we need a ConfigMap in Kubernetes?
● A ConfigMap is used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs. It allows
you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content, enabling you to modify
application settings without rebuilding your container images.

39. Which AWS services do you consider when setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices
application?
● For a CI/CD pipeline, I would consider using:
○ AWS CodeCommit for source control.
○ AWS CodeBuild for building and testing.
○ AWS CodeDeploy or Amazon EKS for deployment.
○ AWS CodePipeline to orchestrate the CI/CD process.
○ Amazon S3 for artifact storage.
○ AWS Lambda for any custom automation tasks.

40. On a day with unusually high traffic for an e-commerce application, how would you, as a cloud
engineer, manage the current setup to handle the load smoothly?
● I would ensure that Auto Scaling Groups are properly configured to handle the increased
demand by automatically adding more instances. I'd also verify that the load balancers are
evenly distributing traffic and consider enabling caching (e.g., using Amazon CloudFront) to
reduce the load on backend servers. Monitoring tools like CloudWatch would be used to
track performance metrics and adjust resources in real-time.
● Strategies:
○ Auto Scaling: Scale up instances automatically to handle the increased load.
○ Caching: Use a caching layer to reduce the load on your application servers.
○ Load Balancing: Distribute traffic evenly across available instances.
○ Database Optimization: Ensure your database is properly configured and optimized for
performance.
○ Monitoring: Closely monitor system metrics to identify bottlenecks and adjust resources
accordingly.

41. If traffic is currently handled on a single instance, how would you upgrade for high availability
in AWS?
● To upgrade for high availability, I would:
○ Deploy multiple instances across different Availability Zones (AZs) using an Auto
Scaling Group.
○ Set up a Load Balancer (ALB or NLB) to distribute traffic across these instances.
○ Configure health checks to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances.
○ Use Multi-AZ deployments for databases like RDS to ensure data availability.

42. When auto-scaling instances, how do you manage the backend RDS database?
● To manage the backend RDS database during auto-scaling:
○ Enable Multi-AZ for high availability and automatic failover.
○ Use RDS Read Replicas to handle read-heavy traffic, reducing the load on the primary
database.
○ Scale RDS vertically (instance size) or horizontally (read replicas) based on the
database workload.
○ Monitor performance using Amazon CloudWatch and adjust as necessary.

43. Have you ever set up cross-account access for S3? For example, if the QA team needs access
to the production database.
● Yes, I've set up cross-account access by:
○ Creating an IAM role in the production account with the necessary S3 permissions.
○ Establishing a trust relationship to allow the QA account to assume that role.
○ Using S3 bucket policies to grant access from the QA account.
○ QA team members can then assume the role using AWS STS (Security Token
Service) to access the production S3 bucket.

44. How can an S3 account in Account A access an S3 account in Account B?
● Account A can access Account B’s S3 bucket by:
○ Setting up a bucket policy in Account B that grants Account A the necessary
permissions.
○ Creating an IAM role in Account B with permissions for S3 and allowing Account A to
assume that role via a trust policy.
○ Using AWS STS to assume the role from Account A and access the S3 bucket in
Account B.

45. Can you differentiate between IAM policies and IAM roles?
● IAM Policies: These are sets of permissions attached to users, groups, or roles, defining
what actions are allowed or denied.
● IAM Roles: These are identities with specific permissions that can be assumed by entities
like users, applications, or AWS services. Roles are often used for temporary access or
cross-account access.

46. Can you explain the STS assume role policy?
● The STS (Security Token Service) AssumeRole policy allows a user or service to assume a
role in a different account or within the same account. This provides temporary security
credentials with the permissions associated with the assumed role, enabling cross-account
access or delegation of permissions.

47. Have you experienced any challenging issues or incidents in your project? How did you and
your team identify and resolve them?
● Yes, one challenge was a sudden traffic spike causing performance degradation. We
identified the issue using CloudWatch metrics and logs, pinpointing the bottleneck in the
database. The resolution involved scaling the database vertically and adding read replicas to
distribute the load, along with optimizing slow-running queries.
48. What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker?
● CMD: Provides default arguments for the entrypoint or the command to run if no other
command is provided.
● ENTRYPOINT: Defines the executable that will always run, with CMD as its default
arguments. ENTRYPOINT is useful when you want your container to behave like a specific
executable.
● Example: ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"] ensures app.py is always executed,
while CMD allows passing different arguments.
49. Have you ever managed an application single-handedly?
● Yes, I have managed applications single-handedly, handling tasks such as deployment,
monitoring, troubleshooting, and scaling. This involved setting up the infrastructure, CI/CD
pipelines, and ensuring high availability and security.

like Python, JavaScript, and Go.
52. What is the difference between public and private networking?
● Public Networking: Refers to networks that are accessible from the internet. Public IP
addresses are used, and resources are exposed to external access.
● Private Networking: Refers to networks that are isolated from the public internet. Resources
within a private network communicate with each other securely using private IP addresses,
and access from outside is typically restricted.
53. What is a Docker registry and why do we need it?
● Docker Registry: A storage and distribution system for Docker images. It allows you to store,
share, and manage Docker container images. Docker Hub is a popular public registry, but you
can also set up private registries.
● Why We Need It: Docker registries allow teams to version, share, and deploy Docker images
easily. They support CI/CD pipelines by enabling automated builds and deployments.
54. What is a secrets manager?
● Secrets Manager: A tool or service that securely stores and manages sensitive information
such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and tokens. Examples include AWS Secrets
Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and Azure Key Vault.
● Purpose: To securely store and access secrets without hardcoding them into application
code or configuration files.
55. What is the secure way to manage sensitive information?
    ● Use a Secrets Manager: Store secrets in a dedicated service like AWS Secrets Manager,
Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault.
● Environment Variables: Use environment variables to inject secrets at runtime rather than
storing them in code.

you do it? Have you used Helm charts or other CD tools? How would you
handle a project with multiple microservices on Kubernetes?
● Using Kubernetes Instead of EC2: You would deploy your applications on a Kubernetes
cluster rather than directly on EC2 instances. This involves setting up an EKS (Elastic
Kubernetes Service) cluster in AWS or using another managed Kubernetes service.
● Helm Charts: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you manage Kubernetes
applications. You can use Helm charts to deploy and manage multiple microservices in a
consistent and repeatable manner.
● Handling Multiple Microservices: Use Kubernetes namespaces to isolate microservices, and
manage their deployment using Helm charts or a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, ArgoCD, or GitLab
CI/CD. Implement service discovery, networking, and security policies to ensure seamless
communication between microservices.
60. How do you connect a bastion host to a private network? Can you
explain VPC and VPC peering?
● Connecting a Bastion Host: A bastion host is typically set up in a public subnet of a Virtual
Private Cloud (VPC) with access to the private network. Users connect to the bastion host
via SSH, and from there, they can access resources in the private subnet.
● VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A logically isolated section of a cloud provider's network where
you can launch and manage resources. It allows you to define IP ranges, subnets, route
tables, and network gateways.
● VPC Peering: A network connection between two VPCs that allows traffic to be routed
between them using private IP addresses. This is useful for connecting resources across
different VPCs without going over the public internet.
61. Have you configured a system where code is automatically merged and published upon a

deployments, and optimizing resource allocation aligns with the responsibilities of this role. I also
bring problem-solving skills and a proactive approach to ensuring system reliability, which will
contribute to the success of the team and organization.
66. Can you share an instance where you provided a solution for cost optimization while managing
resource allocation?
In a previous project, I noticed that our cloud infrastructure was over-provisioned, leading to
unnecessary costs. I implemented auto-scaling based on actual usage metrics and utilized spot
instances for non-critical workloads. Additionally, I restructured the storage solution by moving
infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage classes. These changes resulted in a significant
reduction in our monthly cloud expenses without compromising performance.
67. Describe a situation where the entire production instance crashed, and you had to fix it quickly.
Have you experienced such a scenario?
Yes, I have experienced such a scenario. In one instance, our production server crashed due to a
memory leak in the application. I quickly identified the issue using monitoring tools like Prometheus
and logs from ELK Stack. To resolve it, I restarted the affected services and temporarily scaled up
the infrastructure to handle the load. I then worked with the development team to identify and fix the
memory leak, ensuring it didn’t happen again.
68. What is blue-green deployment and why is it needed?
● Blue-Green Deployment: A deployment strategy where two identical environments (Blue and
Green) are maintained. The Blue environment is the active production environment, while the
Green is the idle one. During deployment, the new version is deployed to the Green
environment. After testing, traffic is switched to Green, making it the new production
environment.
● Why Needed:
○ Minimal Downtime: Reduces downtime as the switch between environments is
instantaneous.
○ Easy Rollback: If issues arise, switching back to the Blue environment is
straightforward.
○ Improved Reliability: Reduces the risk of deployment failures affecting users.
69. What other deployment strategies do you know?
● Canary Deployment: Gradually rolling out the new version to a small subset of users before a
full deployment.
