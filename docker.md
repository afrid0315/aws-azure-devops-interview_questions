## Docker Interview Questions & Answers

#### 1. Docker container will get reboot failure what you will do if it won't work ?
**Answer.** If a Docker container faces reboot failure, I would first investigate the container logs using the docker logs command to identify any error messages or issues. I might also check the container's configuration and dependencies. If the problem persists, I may try restarting the Docker daemon, updating Docker, or recreating the container with proper configurations. If all else fails, I may need to troubleshoot the underlying host system or consult Docker community forums for assistance.

#### 2. Write a docker file to copy a file from the system to container with a volume mount?
**Answer.**
```
FROM ubuntu:latest
# Create a directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
# Copy a file from the host system to the container
COPY ./localfile.txt /app/
# Define a volume mount
VOLUME /app/data
# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app/data
```

#### 3. What is docker networks?
**Answer.** Docker Networks are vital for defining communication patterns, ensuring proper isolation, and facilitating containerized application deployment.

#### 4. How the port forwading is done in docker?
**Answer.**
``
docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-app
``
This command forwards traffic from port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container. Now, accessing http://localhost:8080 on the host system will be directed to the web application running on port 80 inside the container. Port forwarding enables communication between the host and containerized applications.

#### 5. Docker commands?
**Answer.** Mostly used commands:
```
docker run - run a container from an image
docker pull - pull an image from a registry
docker push - push an image to a registry

```

#### 6. What is difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
**Answer.** In Docker, ENTRYPOINT is used to set the default executable for a container, defining the command and its arguments. It is often used for the main application process. On the other hand, CMD is used to provide default command-line arguments for the ENTRYPOINT or the default command to be executed if ENTRYPOINT is not specified. Both are instructions in a Dockerfile, but ENTRYPOINT is primarily for setting the main executable, while CMD is for providing default parameters or a fallback command.

#### 7. How docker is integrated in jenkins
**Answer.** Docker is integrated into Jenkins through the Docker Pipeline plugin. This plugin enables the use of Docker containers within Jenkins pipelines, allowing developers to define, build, and run their applications in isolated and reproducible environments. It simplifies the integration of Docker-based workflows, providing seamless containerization support in Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.

#### 8. Write a dockerfile for tomcat container?
**Answer.** 
```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y open-jdk-8-jre wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.59/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.59.tar.gz \
    && tar -xf apache-tomcat-9.0.59.tar.gz -C /opt \
    && ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.59 /opt/tomcat \
    && rm apache-tomcat-9.0.59.tar.gz

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh", "run"]
```

#### 9. Write a docker file for java application?
**Answer.** 
```
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a base image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file into the container at /app
COPY target/your-java-app.jar /app/your-java-app.jar

# Specify the default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["java", "-jar", "your-java-app.jar"]
```
