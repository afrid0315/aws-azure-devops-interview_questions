## Docker Interview Questions & Answers

#### 1. Docker container will get reboot failure what you will do if it won't work ?
**Answer.** If a Docker container faces reboot failure, I would first investigate the container logs using the docker logs command to identify any error messages or issues. I might also check the container's configuration and dependencies. If the problem persists, I may try restarting the Docker daemon, updating Docker, or recreating the container with proper configurations. If all else fails, I may need to troubleshoot the underlying host system or consult Docker community forums for assistance.

#### 2. Write a docker file to copy a file from the system to container with a volume mount?
**Answer.**
```
FROM ubuntu:latest
# Create a directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
# Copy a file from the host system to the container
COPY ./localfile.txt /app/
# Define a volume mount
VOLUME /app/data
# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app/data
```

#### 3. What is docker networks?
**Answer.** Docker Networks are vital for defining communication patterns, ensuring proper isolation, and facilitating containerized application deployment.

https://docs.docker.com/network/

#### 4. How the port forwading is done in docker?
**Answer.**
``
docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-app
``
This command forwards traffic from port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container. Now, accessing http://localhost:8080 on the host system will be directed to the web application running on port 80 inside the container. Port forwarding enables communication between the host and containerized applications.

#### 6. What is difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
**Answer.** In Docker, ENTRYPOINT is used to set the default executable for a container, defining the command and its arguments. It is often used for the main application process. On the other hand, CMD is used to provide default command-line arguments for the ENTRYPOINT or the default command to be executed if ENTRYPOINT is not specified. Both are instructions in a Dockerfile, but ENTRYPOINT is primarily for setting the main executable, while CMD is for providing default parameters or a fallback command.

#### 7. How docker is integrated in jenkins
**Answer.** Docker is integrated into Jenkins through the Docker Pipeline plugin. This plugin enables the use of Docker containers within Jenkins pipelines, allowing developers to define, build, and run their applications in isolated and reproducible environments. It simplifies the integration of Docker-based workflows, providing seamless containerization support in Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.

#### 8. Write a dockerfile for tomcat container?
**Answer.** 
```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y open-jdk-8-jre wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.59/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.59.tar.gz \
    && tar -xf apache-tomcat-9.0.59.tar.gz -C /opt \
    && ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.59 /opt/tomcat \
    && rm apache-tomcat-9.0.59.tar.gz

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh", "run"]
```

#### 9. Write a docker file for java application?
**Answer.** 
```
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a base image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file into the container at /app
COPY target/your-java-app.jar /app/your-java-app.jar

# Specify the default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["java", "-jar", "your-java-app.jar"]
```

#### 10. Difference between docker stop and docker kill?
**Answer.** docker stop initiates a graceful shutdown, while docker kill forcefully terminates the container without giving it a chance to clean up.

#### 11. Command to list continers which state is exited?
**Answer.** This command shows all containers (including those that have exited) and filters the output to display only containers with the "exited" status. The -a flag ensures that both running and exited containers are considered.
```
docker ps -a --filter "status=exited"
```

#### 12. Command to clean-up docker host ( deleting stopped conatiners, dangling images and unused networks)?
**Answer.** 
`docker container prune -f`: Deletes all stopped containers.
`docker image prune -f`: Removes dangling images (images with no tag).
`docker network prune -f`: Deletes unused networks.
Make sure to use these commands cautiously, as they will irreversibly remove the specified resources. The -f flag is used to force the removal without interactive confirmation.

#### 13. What version of docker you have used? Specific reason to use that particular version?
**Answer.** I have used 20.10.17 docker version. There is no particular reason.

#### 14. Can we have multiple CMD in Dockerfile?
**Answer.** No, a Dockerfile can only have one CMD instruction. If you include multiple CMD instructions, only the last one will take effect.

#### 15. Have you worked on docker swarm and docker compose?
**Answer.** Yes, I have experience working with Docker Swarm and Docker Compose. Docker Swarm is used for orchestrating and managing distributed Docker applications, providing features like service scaling and load balancing. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, simplifying the process of setting up and running complex services.

#### 16. Difference between docker attach and docker exec?
**Answer. docker attach** is used to connect to a running container's main process and take control of its input and output.

**docker exec** is used to run a command inside a running container without changing its main process, allowing for more flexibility in executing commands and interacting with containerized applications.

#### 17. How will you run multiple Docker containers in one single host? 
**Answer:** Docker Compose is the best way to run multiple containers as a single service by defining them in a docker-compose.yml file.

#### 18. If you delete a running container, what happens to the data stored in that container? 
**Answer:** When a running container is deleted, all data in its file system also goes away. However, we can use Docker Data Volumes to persist data even if the container is deleted.

#### 19. How do you manage sensitive security data like passwords in Docker? 
**Answer:** Docker Secrets and Docker Environment Variables can be used to manage sensitive data.

#### 20. What is the difference between Docker Image and a Docker Container? 
**Answer:** Docker Image is a template that contains the application, libraries, and dependencies required to run an application, whereas a Docker Container is the running instance of a Docker Image.

#### 21. How do you handle persistent storage in Docker? 
**Answer:** Docker Volumes and Docker Bind Mounts are used to handle persistent storage in Docker.

#### 22. What is the process to create a Docker Container from a Dockerfile? 
**Answer:** Docker Build command is used to create Docker images from a Dockerfile and then Docker Run command is used to create Containers from Docker images.

#### 23. How will you scale Docker containers based on traffic to your application? 
**Answer:** Docker Swarm or Kubernetes can be used to auto-scale Docker Containers based on traffic load.

#### 24. When RUN and CMD instructions will be executed?
**Answer:** RUN instruction will be executed while building the Docker Image. CMD instruction will be executed while starting the Container.

#### 25. What’s the different between COPY and ADD instructions?
**Answer:** Using COPY instruction,We can copy local files and folders from docker build context to Docker Image. These files and folders will be copied while creating a Docker Image.
ADD instruction works similar to COPY instruction but the only different is that we can download files from remote locations(Git GitHub, S3, URL) that’s from Internet while creating a Docker Image.

#### 26. What’s the different between CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions?
**Answer:** CMD instruction will be used to start the process or application inside the Container.
ENTRYPOINT instruction also works similar to CMD instruction. ENTRYPOINT instruction will also be executed while creating a container. CMD instruction can be overridden while creating a Container where as ENTRYPOINT instruction cannot be overridden while creating a Container.

#### 27. When we have both CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions in a Dockerfile?
**Answer:** CMD instruction will not be executed and CMD instruction will be passed as an argument for ENTRYPOINT.

#### 28. Is Docker container itself or container runtime?
**Answer:** Docker is a container runtime. It provides a platform for building, managing, and running containers, which are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments for running applications. The Docker runtime enables the creation and execution of containers based on Docker images, which contain all the necessary dependencies and configurations to run an application.

#### 29. Why would you use Docker? Over a virtual machine and give an example?
**Answer:** Docker provides lightweight, portable containers for running applications, offering benefits such as efficient resource utilization, faster deployment, and consistent environments. Compared to virtual machines, Docker containers have lower overhead and faster startup times. For example, if you want to run a web application, you can use Docker to package the application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

#### 30. Let's say I have like okay, I have a Docker image in Docker Hub. And I want to, like use that image to start a Docker container on your local laptop or an EC2 instance what command would we use?
**Answer:** To start a Docker container from an image available on Docker Hub, you can use the docker run command followed by the image name. For example: docker run <image_name>.

#### 31. If I want to create an Docker image. What command would I use?
**Answer:** To create a Docker image, you can use the docker build command followed by the path to the Dockerfile and an optional tag for the image. For example: docker build -t <image_name> <path_to_Dockerfile>.

#### 32. What's the difference between Docker build and Docker Compose?
**Answer:** Docker build is used to build Docker images from a Dockerfile, while Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Docker Compose uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to specify the services, networks, and volumes required for the application, making it easier to manage complex deployments with multiple interconnected containers.

#### 33. For example, let's say you have X number of Docker containers running on a machine right and maybe an instant easy to instance or server or whatever. How would you check those containers like what command would you use?
**Answer:** To check running Docker containers, you can use the docker ps command. This command lists all running containers along with their IDs, names, status, ports, and other details.

#### 34. Let's say there was seven containers running on a machine out of those two stops for some reason. And someone asks you like hey, can we check what happened to those two containers? Like what can you do from here to see why those two containers stopped?
**Answer:** If containers have stopped unexpectedly, you can use the docker ps -a command to list all containers, including stopped ones. Then, you can use the docker logs <container_id> command to view the logs of a specific container and identify the reason for its failure.

#### 35. Let's say paint shop for whatever reasons. And someone asks you like hey, can we check what happened there? How would you approach?
**Answer:** To investigate why a container failed, you can inspect its logs using the docker logs <container_id> command. Additionally, you can check the container's exit code using the docker inspect --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}' <container_id> command to get more information about the reason for its failure.
